1051,Waiting to say the right thing
1052,I pulled it out the other day
1053,But the diamond had lost its shine

6830,But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though

6832,So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle enough rhymes
6833,To maybe try to help get some people through tough times

6852,You write normal? Fuck being normal!
6853,And I just bought a new raygun from the future
6854,"Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad"

6856,Singin' to a man while he played piano
6857,"Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel"

7264,I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
7265,Get along with the voices inside of my head
7266,"You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath"
7267,"And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy"
7268,"Well, that's nothin'"
7269,"Well, that's nothin'"
7270,"Call me crazy, but I have this vision, one day that"
7271,I'll walk amongst you a regular civilian
7272,"But until then, drums get killed and"
7273,"I'm comin' straight at MC's, blood gets spilled and"
7274,I'll take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track
7275,Give every kid who got played that pumped-up feelin'
7276,And shit to say back to the kids who played him
7277,I ain't here to save the fuckin' children
7278,But if one kid out of a hundred million
7279,"Who are goin' through a struggle, feels it and relates, that's great!"
7280,"It's payback, Russell Wilson fallin' way back"
7281,"In the draft, turn nothin' into somethin', still can make that"
7282,"Straw into gold, chump, I will spin—Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack"
7283,Maybe I need a straightjacket
7284,"Face facts: I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that!"
7285,"It's nothin', I'm still friends with the—"
7286,I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed
7287,Get along with the voices inside of my head
7288,"You're tryin' to save me, stop holdin' your breath"
7289,"And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy"

7294,"And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy"
7295,"Well, that's nothin'"
7296,]
7297,"Well, that's nothin'"
7298,"Woah, Joyner, Joyner, yeah, yeah, yeah"
7299,"Yeah, I done did a lot of things in my day, I admit it"
7300,"I don't take back what I say, if I said it then I meant it"
7301,"All my life I want a Grammy, but I'll prolly never get it"
7302,I ain't never had no trophy or no motherfuckin' ribbon
7303,"Fuck the system, I'm that nigga, bend the law, cut the rules"
7304,"I'm about to risk it all, I ain't got too much to lose"
7305,"Y'all been eatin' long enough, it's my turn to cut the food"
7306,"Pass the plate! Where my drink? This my day, lucky you"
7307,"Fuck you too, woo!"
7308,"Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move"

7313,"Turn my back on you, all of you finished"
7314,"Back to these bullets, it's back to the job"
7315,Pull my MAC out and all of you runnin'
7316,"Back on my hood shit, it's back to the pushin'"
7317,These packs and I'm actually pumpin'
7318,"Can't fuck with you rappers, you practically suckin'"
7319,You mighta went platinum but that don't mean nothin'
7320,I'm actually buzzin' this time
7321,"Straight out the kitchen, I told 'em the oven is mine"
7322,I do not fuck with you guys
7323,"If I don't kill you, just know you gon' suffer this time"
7324,I ain't no gangster but I got some bangers
7325,Some chains and some blades and a couple of knives
7326,"Choppers and jammies, a partridge, a pear tree"
7327,My 12 days of Christmas was nothin' but lies
7328,Run at you hard like a sumo
7329,They say I talk like a chulo
7330,"I live in Mars, I'm not Bruno"
7331,"Bitch I'm a dog, call me Cujo"
7332,"You play your cards, I reverse on you all"
7333,And I might just draw 4 like a Uno
7334,"Cállate boca mejor, maricón, little puto, and all of you culo"
7335,They've invented a level up in the ghetto to get old
7336,Lookin' for somethin' I prolly can never find now
7337,Shit get relevant 'til 'nother beef die down
7338,"In truth, a nigga just really want me tied down"
7339,I've been alone and I never needed nobody
7340,"Just only me and my shotty, I'll tell these niggas to lie down"
7341,"Keep all the money, I never wanted the lifestyle"
7342,I just pray to God that my son'll be alright now
7343,I said ain't no love for the other side
7344,Or anyone who ever want smoke
7345,When I die I'm goin' out as the underdog who never lost hope
7346,You in the wrong cab down the wrong path
7347,"Nigga, wrong way, wrong road"
7348,Snakes in the grass tryna slither fast
7349,I just bought a fuckin' lawn mower
7350,"I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it"
7351,"This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it"
7352,"I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em"
7353,"Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition"
7354,Fuck's the difference?
7355,"I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules"
7356,"Man, I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose"
7357,"I've been eatin' long enough, man, my stomach should be full"
7358,"I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me"
7359,Fuck you think?
7360,I got a couple of mansions
7361,Still I don't have any manners
7362,You got a couple of ghost writers
7363,But to these kids it don't actually matter
7364,"They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"""
7365,"I said, ""I don't have any answers."""
7366,'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album
7367,It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers
7368,And actually comin' from humble beginnings
7369,I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning
7370,"I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!"""
7371,"""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"""
7372,But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability
7373,"To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me"
7374,The inability to pen humility
7375,"Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of"
7376,Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em?
7377,"Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular"
7378,"Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up"
7379,Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck
7380,About the ones that were here before you that made rap
7381,"Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks"
7382,"ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at?"
7383,We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back
7384,'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage
7385,"All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap"
7386,"I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad"
7387,"But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat"
7388,"That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that"
7389,But I think it's inevitable
7390,They know what button to press or what lever to pull
7391,To get me to snap though
7392,And if I pay it attention I'm prob'ly makin' it bigger
7393,"But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho"
7394,"On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin'"
7395,Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits
7396,I'm asleep at the wheel again
7397,As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent
7398,Of another beat I'ma kill again
7399,'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again
7400,Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
7401,It better be at least 70 or 300 milligram
7402,And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
7403,"Levels to this shit, I got an elevator"
7404,You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker
7405,I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
7406,"Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater"
7407,"Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way"
7408,I got spite inside my DNA
7409,"But I roll 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy"
7410,It's the moment y'all been waitin' for
7411,Like California wishin' rain to pour
7412,"In that drought, y'all been prayin' for"
7413,My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw
7414,"Still the same Marshall, that outlaw"
7415,That they say as a writer might've fell off
7416,I'm back on that bull like the cowboy
7417,"So y'all gotta move , y'all gotta move , y'all gotta move"
7418,"Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice"
7419,"Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot"
7420,"Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice"
7421,*Plane crash*
7422,Yeah
7423,"Yo, I'm just gonna write down my first thoughts, and see where this takes me, ’cause I feel like I wanna punch the world in the fuckin' face right now"
7424,Yeah
7425,Let me explain just how to make greatness
7426,"Straight out the gate, I'm ’bout to break it down"
7427,"Ain't no mistakes allowed, but make no mistake, I'm 'bout"
7428,"To rape the alphabet, I may raise some brows"
7429,If I press the issue just to get the anger out
7430,Full magazine could take Staples out
7431,Savage but ain't thinkin' 'bout no bank account
7432,"But bitch, I'm off the chain like Kala Brown"
7433,"Motherfucker, shut the fuck up when I’m talkin’, lil' bitch"
7434,"I’m sorry, wait, what's your talent? Oh, critiquin'"
7435,"My talent? Oh, bitch, I don't know who the fuck y’all are"
7436,To give a sub-par bar or even have an opinion or view
7437,"You mention me, millions of views, attention in news"
7438,"I mention you, lose-lose for me, win-win for you"
7439,"Billions of views, your ten cents are two"
7440,Skim through the music to give shit reviews
7441,"To get clicks, but bitch, you just lit the fuse"
7442,"Don't get misconstrued, business as us'"
7443,"Shit-list renewed, so get shit to do"
7444,Or get dissed 'cause I just don't get
7445,What the fuck half the shit is that you're listenin' to
7446,Do you have any idea how much I hate this choppy flow
7447,Everyone copies though? Prob'ly no
7448,"Get this fuckin' audio out my Audi, yo, adiós"
7449,"I can see why people like Lil Yachty, but not me though"
7450,"Not even dissin', it just ain't for me"
7451,All I am simply is just an emcee
7452,"Maybe ""Stan"" just isn't your cup of tea"
7453,Maybe your cup's full of syrup and lean
7454,"Maybe I need to stir up shit, preferably"
7455,Shake the world up if it were up to me
7456,"Paul wants me to chill, y'all want me to ill"
7457,"I should eat a pill, probably I will"
7458,"Old me killed the new me, watch him bleed to death"
7459,"I breathe on the mirror, I don't see my breath"
7460,"Possibly I'm dead, I must be possessed"
7461,"Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L"
7462,Jam a Crest Whitestrip in the tip of my dick
7463,"With an ice pick, stick it in a vise grip"
7464,"Hang it on a spike fence, bang it with a pipe wrench"
7465,While I take my ball sack and flick it like a light switch
7466,Like Vice President Mike Pence
7467,Back up on my shit in a sidekick as I lay it on a spike strip
7468,These are things that I'd rather do than hear you on a mic
7469,Since nine tenths of your rhyme is about ice and
7470,"Jesus Christ, man, how many times is"
7471,Someone gonna fuck on my bitch?
7472,You won't ever see Em icy
7473,But as cold as I get on the M-I-C
7474,"I polarize shit, so the Thames might freeze"
7475,And your skull might split like I bashed you upside it
7476,"Bitch, I got the club on smash like a nightstick"
7477,Turn down for what?
7478,"I ain't loud enough, nah, turn the Valium up"
7479,'Cause I don't know how I'm gonna get your mouths to shut
7480,Now when it doesn't matter what caliber
7481,"I spit at, I'll bet a hundred thousand bucks"
7482,"You'll turn around and just be like, ""Man, how the fuck"
7483,Sourpuss gonna get mad just 'cause his album sucks?
7484,"And now he wants to take it out on us"""
7485,"But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy"
7486,Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
7487,It'll help me get back to myself and she'll love me
7488,I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
7489,I'd just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
7490,Especially an effing Recovery clone of me
7491,"So finger-bang, chicken wang, MGK, Igg' Azae'"
7492,"Lil Pump, Lil Xan imitate Lil Wayne"
7493,"I should aim at everybody in the game, pick a name"
7494,I'm fed up with bein' humble
7495,"And rumor is I'm hungry, I'm sure you heard rumblings"
7496,I heard you wanna rumble like an empty stomach
7497,I heard your mumblin' but it's jumbled in mumbo-jumbo
7498,"The era that I'm from will pummel you, that's what it's comin' to"
7499,What the fuck you're gonna do when you run into it?
7500,I'm gonna crumble you and I'll take a number two
7501,"And dump on you, if you ain't Joyner"
7502,"If you ain't Kendrick or Cole or Sean, then you're a goner"
7503,I'm 'bout to bring it to anyone in this bitch who want it
7504,I guess when you walk into BK you expect a Whopper
7505,You can order a Quarter Pounder when you go to McDonald's
7506,But if you're lookin' to get a porterhouse you better go get Revival
7507,But y'all are actin' like I tried to serve you up a slider
7508,Maybe the vocals shoulda been auto-tuned
7509,And you woulda bought it
7510,But sayin' I no longer got it
7511,'Cause you missed a line and never caught it
7512,"'Cause it went over your head, because you're too stupid to get it"
7513,"'Cause you're mentally retarded, but pretend to be the smartest"
7514,"With your expertise and knowledge, but you'll never be an artist"
7515,And I'm harder on myself than you could ever be regardless
7516,"What I'll never be is flawless, all I'll ever be is honest"
7517,Even when I'm gone they're gonna say I brought it
7518,Even when I hit my forties like a fuckin' alcoholic
7519,With a bottle full of malt liquor
7520,But I couldn't bottle this shit any longer
7521,The fact that I know that I'ma hit my bottom
7522,If I don't pull myself from the jaws of defeat and rise to my feet
7523,I don't see why y'all even started with me
7524,"I get in beefs, my enemies die"
7525,I don't cease fire 'til at least all are deceased
7526,"I'm east side, never be caught slippin'"
7527,"Now you see why I don't sleep, not even a wink, I don't blink"
7528,"I don't doze off, I don't even nod to the beats"
7529,I don't even close my fuckin' eyes when I sneeze
7530,"""Aw, man! That BET cypher was weak, it was garbage"
7531,"The Thing ain't even orange—oh my God, that's a reach!"""
7532,Shout to all my colorblind people
7533,"Each and everyone of y'all, if you call a fire engine green"
7534,"Aquamarine, or you think water is pink"
7535,"""Dawg, that's a date."" — ""Looks like an olive to me."""
7536,"""Look, there's an apple!"" — ""No, it's not, it's a peach!"""
7537,"So finger-bang, Pootie Tang"
7538,"Burger King, Gucci Gang, dookie, dang"
7539,"Charlamagne gonna hate anyway, doesn't matter what I say"
7540,Give me Donkey of the Day
7541,What a way for 2018 to get underway
7542,But I'm gonna say everything that I wanna say
7543,"Welcome to the slaughterhouse, bitch!"
7544,Invite 'em in like a One A Day
7545,I'm not done
7546,'Cause I feel like the beast of burden
7547,"That line in the sand, was it even worth it?"
7548,'Cause the way I see people turning's
7549,"Makin' it seem worthless, it's startin' to defeat the purpose"
7550,I'm watchin' my fan base shrink to thirds
7551,"And I was just tryin' to do the right thing, but word"
7552,Has the court of public opinion reached a verdict
7553,Or still yet to be determined?
7554,"'Cause I'm determined to be me, critiqued or worshipped"
7555,"But if I could go back, I'd at least reword it"
7556,And say I empathize with the people this evil serpent
7557,Sold the dream to that he's deserted
7558,But I think it's workin'
7559,These verses are makin' him a wee bit nervous
7560,And he's too scurred to answer me with words
7561,'Cause he knows that he will lyrically get murdered
7562,But I know at least he's heard it
7563,'Cause Agent Orange just sent the Secret Service
7564,To meet in person to see if I really think of hurtin' him
7565,Or ask if I'm linked to terrorists
7566,"I said, ""Only when it comes to ink and lyricists."""
7567,But my beef is more media journalists
7568,"I said, my beef is more meaty, a journalist"
7569,Can get a mouthful of flesh
7570,"And yes, I mean eating a penis"
7571,'Cause they've been pannin' my album to death
7572,So I've been givin' the media fingers
7573,Don't wanna turn this to a counseling sesh
7574,But they've been puttin' me through the ringer
7575,So I ain't ironin' shit out with the press
7576,But I just took this beat to the cleaners
7577,"I've been a liar, been a thief"
7578,"Been a lover, been a cheat"
7579,"All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me"
7580,"Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something"
7581,If all it's gonna cause is pain
7582,Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
7583,So let the river run
7584,"He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack"
7585,"Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched"
7586,"On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict"
7587,And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
7588,"It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack"
7589,She's kept track of all his Internet chats
7590,And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
7591,"Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks"
7592,"'Cause she loves danger, psychopath"
7593,"And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that"
7594,But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
7595,"Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand"
7596,So she's been on the web lately
7597,"Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man"
7598,"And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care"
7599,"Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said ""Bye Suzanne"""
7600,"After the first night, but tonight I am"
7601,"I've been a liar, been a thief"
7602,"Been a lover, been a cheat"
7603,"All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me"
7604,"Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something"
7605,If all it's gonna cause is pain
7606,The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
7607,So let the river run
7608,A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
7609,"It was ""come sunlight, scram,"" now we hug tight, and..."
7610,"He found out, now she feels deserted and used"
7611,"'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too"
7612,Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
7613,"It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue"
7614,"Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth"
7615,"Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you"
7616,"So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners"
7617,Don't have to be reserved in a booth
7618,I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
7619,"Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew"
7620,And now that I got you I don't want you
7621,Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
7622,Why do I do this dirt that I do?
7623,"Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech"
7624,Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
7625,'Cause now with her in the womb
7626,"We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew"
7627,To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
7628,Fuck!
7629,"I've been a liar, been a thief"
7630,"Been a lover, been a cheat"
7631,"All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me"
7632,"Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something"
7633,If all it's gonna cause is pain
7634,The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
7635,So let the river run
7636,"My name's , my name's"
7637,"River , river run"
7638,"Call me , call me"
7639,"River , we'll let the river run"
7640,"Always the bridesmaid, never ""The bride, hey!"""
7641,Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
7642,"And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes"
7643,"Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe"
7644,That's why I may have came at you sideways
7645,I can't keep my lies straight
7646,But I made you terminate my baby
7647,"This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled"
7648,What else can I say? It was fun for a while
7649,Bet I really woulda loved your smile
7650,"Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it"
7651,"What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?"
7652,"I've been a liar, been a thief"
7653,"Been a lover, been a cheat"
7654,"All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me"
7655,"Well, little one"
7656,I don't want to admit to something
7657,If all it's gonna cause is pain
7658,The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
7659,So let the river run
7660,I got a song filled with shit for the strong-willed
7661,When the world gives you a raw deal
7662,"Sets you off 'til you scream, ""Piss off! Screw you!"""
7663,When it talks to you like you don't belong
7664,Or tells you you're in the wrong field
7665,When something's in your mitochondrial

8154,"My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father"

8281,"Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya"
8282,A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
8283,Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
8284,Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
8285,By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
8286,When I'm rocking the table while he's operating

8512,I turned to rap 'cause it made me feel tough when I wasn't
8513,"From the moment I heard rappers cussin', I was in"
8514,Which is why I identify with the guy
8515,"Who I was invented by, Dre's Frankenstein"
8516,Energized like a nine volt
8517,"Ice cold like Snake Eyes, twice in a row on a dice roll"
8518,But if the only reason I blowed is 'cause I'm white though
8519,Why don't every other white rapper sell what I sold?
8520,"Kamikaze pilot, I wrote my suicide note"
8521,Here come the guys in white coats tryin' to stop me
8522,'Fore I jump behind the controls and try to fly into foes
8523,'Cause I'm takin' y'all with me when I go cyclone
8524,"I don't think this typhoon's letting up any time soon, here I go"
8525,"Eyes closed, blindfolded, I'm 'bout to—"

8540,"Kami, kami-kamikaze, kamikaze, kami-kamikaze"
8541,Take a look at what I've done
8542,"I heard your freestyle on Shade 45, that shit was embarrassing"
8543,"There is no way we ever air that shit again, I guarantee that"
8544,"Wait, that shit was so ass it's somethin' we wouldn't dare re-air it"
8545,The shit's embarrassing as me rear-ending Tara Reid bare
8546,"In my therapy chair, my dick is the hair length of Cher"
8547,"Each nut is the chair width of an Acorn stairlift, beware of me"
8548,"Lyrically I'm terrible, better get your lyrics prepared"

8553,"Get the measurin' stick , 12 inches of wood"
8554,"Wait, but I've been goin' for your jugular since Craig G ""Duck Alert"""
8555,And I've come to pay respects
8556,'Cause if you sleep you're fucked—other words
8557,You get laid to rest and I hope your butt is hurt
8558,"Put me on a track, I go cray-on it like a color book"
8559,"You got some views, but you're still below me"
8560,"Mine are higher, so when you compare our views, you get overlooked"
8561,And I don't say the hook unless I wrote the hook
8562,And now I'm just freestylin' in the vocal booth
8563,And you know I've always spoke the truth
8564,You're lyin' through your teeth so much you broke a tooth
8565,And it ain't somethin' I need a phone to do
8566,When I say I can't wait 'til I get ahold of you
8567,And I don't know what I'm s'posed to do
8568,"Line up the rappers, take my pic like a photo shoot"
8569,I walk on water
8570,But I ain't no Jesus
8571,I walk on water
8572,But only when it freezes
8573,Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set?
8574,"My arms, I stretch, but I can’t reach"
8575,"A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as"
8576,"Soon as I grab, squeeze"

8588,I walk on water
8589,But only when it freezes
8590,"It's the curse of the standard, that the first of the Mathers disc set"
8591,Always in search of the verse that I haven’t spit yet
8592,Will this step just be another misstep
8593,"To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect"
8594,"I’ve garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless"
8595,And it always feels like I'm hittin’ the mark
8596,"'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart"
8597,"Like, ""This shit is garbage!"""
8598,"God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless"
8599,"Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded"
8600,"If only they knew, it's a facade and it’s exhaustive"
8601,And I try not to listen to nonsense

8614,"It's true, I'm a Rubik's—a beautiful mess"
8615,"At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest"
8616,"A flawed human, I guess"
8617,But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex–
8618,"pectations and meet 'em, but first"
8619,"The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean"
8620,"He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom?"
8621,"There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm"
8622,Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on

8624,But the only one who's looking down on
8625,Me that matters now's DeShaun
8626,Am I lucky to be around this long?
8627,Begs the question though
8628,Especially after the methadone
8629,As yesterday fades and the Dresden home
8630,Is burnt to the ground and all that's left of my house is lawn
8631,The crowds are gone

8661,"All it takes is one song on the radio, you're"
8662,"Right back on it, reminding me all over again"
8663,How you fucking just brushed me off and left me so burnt
8664,Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
8665,Maybe I needed to grow up a little first
8666,"Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt"
8667,But I'm coming for closure
8668,"Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed, for"
8669,The way that you turned your back on me
8670,Just when I may have needed you most
8671,"Oh, you thought it was over? You could just close the"
8672,Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing

8674,"Well, I've never recovered"
8675,But tonight I bet you that what you're
8676,'Bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered
8677,Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
8678,"Can I hold grudges? Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this."""
8679,"Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive"
8680,"Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset."""

8685,What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
8686,I just hate to be the bad guy
8687,I just hate to be the bad guy
8688,"And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch"
8689,"To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit"
8690,Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it?
8691,"Not this time, you better go and get the sewing kit, bitch!"
8692,"Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew, nitwit"
8693,Thought some time would pass and I'd forget it? Forget it!
8694,You left our family in shambles
8695,"And you expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?"
8696,May be gone but he's not forgotten
8697,And don't think ‘cause he's been out the picture
8698,So long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
8699,You're wrong and that shit was rotten
8700,"And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold"
8701,Have you any idea the shit that I've gone through?
8702,Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
8703,Not once you call to ask me how I'm doing
8704,"Letters, you don't respond to 'em"
8705,"Fuck it, I'm coming to see you"
8706,"And, gee, who better to talk to than you?"
8707,The cause of my problems
8708,"My life is garbage, and I'm 'bout to take it out on you"

8714,What's bad is good and I hate to be the bad guy
8715,I just hate to be the bad guy
8716,I just hate to be the bad guy
8717,I've been driving around your side of this town
8718,Like 9 fricking hours and 45 minutes now
8719,"Finally I found your new address, park in your drive"
8720,Feel like I've been waiting on this moment all of my life
8721,"And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva"
8722,My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house
8723,"See, it's sad it came to this point"
8724,Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
8725,"To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy"
8726,I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
8727,It's revenge that I seek
8728,"So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window"
8729,Like I reach my full potential—I peeked
8730,"Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep"
8731,"Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak"
8732,All the way 'round to the back porch
8733,"Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this"
8734,You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
8735,Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
8736,"Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung"
8737,"Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan"
8738,Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
8739,"Irony's spectacular, huh? Now who's a faggot, you punk?"
8740,And here's your Bronco hat
8741,You can have that shit back ‘cause they suck
8742,"It's just me, you and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it"

8745,"And hey, here's a sequel to my"
8746,Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
8747,How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun!
8748,"Last album now, ‘cause after this you'll be officially done"
8749,"Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell"
8750,"Bitch, I even have your initials"
8751,"I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it"
8752,"Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck"
8753,The best place you could be buried alive is right here
8754,"Two more exits, time is quite near"
8755,"Hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear"
8756,"That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea, as cops appear in my driver's side mirror"
8757,"Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least"
8758,"New plan, Stan!"
8759,"Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car"""

8769,Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
8770,"Nope, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in"

8787,"Batter, but the double-standard you have"
8788,When it comes to your daughters
8789,I represent everything you take for granted
8790,"‘Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona"
8791,"Is half a facade, and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic"
8792,Of you not knowing what you had 'til it's gone
8793,‘Cause after all the glitz and the glam
8794,No more fans that are calling your name

8818,And when you feel weak
8819,You feel like you wanna just give up

8821,Try to find that inner strength
8822,And just pull that shit out of you
8823,And get that motivation to not give up
8824,"And not be a quitter, no matter how bad you wanna just fall"
8825,Flat on your face and collapse
8826,'Til I collapse I'm spillin' these raps long as you feel 'em

8918,"Where you going?"" — ""I'm leaving you!"" — ""No, you ain't!"
8919,"Come back!"" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again"
8920,"It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great"
8921,"I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane"
8922,"But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed"
8923,"I snapped, ""Who's that dude?"", I don't even know his name"
8924,"I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again"
8925,I guess I don't know my own strength
8926,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
8927,"Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts"
8928,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
8929,"Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie"
8930,I love the way you lie
8931,I love the way you lie
8932,You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
8933,"You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em"
8934,"Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em"
8935,Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
8936,"You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em"
8937,Now you're in each other's face
8938,Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
8939,"You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em"
8940,"Throw 'em down, pin 'em"
8941,So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
8942,"It's the rage that took over, it controls you both"
8943,So they say you're best to go your separate ways
8944,Guess that they don't know ya
8945,"'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over"
8946,"It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over"
8947,"But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint"
8948,"You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game"
8949,But you lied again
8950,Now you get to watch her leave out the window
8951,Guess that's why they call it window pane
8952,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
8953,"Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts"
8954,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
8955,"Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie"
8956,I love the way you lie
8957,I love the way you lie
8958,"Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean"
8959,"Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine"
8960,"But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me"
8961,"When it comes to love you're just as blinded, baby, please"
8962,"Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me"
8963,Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
8964,Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
8965,All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
8966,"Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk"
8967,Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
8968,"Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball"
8969,"Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall"
8970,Next time? There won't be no next time!
8971,"I apologize, even though I know it's lies"
8972,"I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar"
8973,"If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her"
8974,"To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—"
8975,Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
8976,"Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts"
8977,Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
8978,"Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie"
8979,I love the way you lie
8980,I love the way you lie

9125,That I'm talkin' about when we riot
9126,You dealin' with a few true villains

9128,And spit true feelings until our tooth fillings
9129,"Come flyin' up out of our mouths, now, rewind it"
9130,"Payback, motherfucker"
9131,"For the way that you doubted me, how's it taste?"
9132,When I slap the taste outta your mouth
9133,With the bass so loud that it shakes the place

9145,"Yeah, I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now. But hey, what'd Daddy always tell you? Straighten up, little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip! What you cryin' about? You got me"
9146,"Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad"
9147,"When I'm gone, but I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had"
9148,"I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh"
9149,"I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry"
9150,"'Cause you're scared, I ain't there"
9151,Daddy's with you in your prayers
9152,"No more cryin', wipe them tears"
9153,"Daddy's here, no more nightmares"
9154,We gon' pull together through it
9155,"We gon' do it, Lainie—Uncle's crazy, ain't he?"
9156,"Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it"
9157,"We're all we got in this world, when it spins, when it swirls"
9158,"When it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls"
9159,"Lookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you"
9160,"Daddy's always on the move, Momma's always on the news"
9161,"I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems"
9162,"The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me"
9163,All the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see
9164,"Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did"
9165,"We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me"
9166,"But things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'"
9167,"Together ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers"
9168,"But then, of course, everything always happens for a reason"
9169,"I guess it was never meant to be, but it's just something"
9170,"We have no control over, and that's what destiny is"
9171,"But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep"
9172,Maybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream
9173,"Now hush, little baby, don't you cry"
9174,Everything's gonna be alright
9175,"Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya"
9176,Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
9177,"I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why"
9178,We fear how we feel inside
9179,"It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby"
9180,"But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright"
9181,"It's funny, I remember back one year when Daddy had no money"
9182,Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree
9183,And said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em
9184,"I'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night cryin'"
9185,"'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job"
9186,But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom
9187,"And at the time, every house that we lived in"
9188,Either kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
9189,And your mom was savin' money for you in a jar
9190,Tryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
9191,"Almost had a thousand dollars, 'til someone broke in and stole it"
9192,And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart
9193,And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart
9194,"Mom and Dad was arguin' a lot, so Momma moved back"
9195,"On to Chalmers in the flat, one bedroom apartment"
9196,And Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
9197,And that's when Daddy went to California with his CD
9198,And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Momma out to see me
9199,"But Daddy had to work, you and Momma had to leave me"
9200,"Then you started seein' Daddy on the TV, and Momma didn't like it"
9201,And you and Lainie were too young to understand it
9202,"Papa was a rolling stone, Momma developed a habit"
9203,And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
9204,I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand
9205,'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
9206,Now I'm sittin' in this empty house
9207,"Just reminiscin', lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out"
9208,"To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now"
9209,"Wow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here"
9210,"Lainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here"
9211,"I like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?"
9212,Sshh! Momma's only gone for the moment
9213,"Now hush, little baby, don't you cry"
9214,Everything's gonna be alright
9215,"Stiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya"
9216,Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
9217,"I know Mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why"
9218,We fear how we feel inside
9219,"It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby"
9220,"But I promise, Momma's gon' be alright"
9221,"And if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird"
9222,I'ma give you the world
9223,"I'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you"
9224,I'll do anything for you to see you smile
9225,And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
9226,I'ma break that birdie's neck
9227,I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
9228,"And make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!"
9229,"Mom, I know I let you down"
9230,And though you say the days are happy
9231,Why is the power off and I'm fucked up?
9232,"And, Mom, I know he's not around"
9233,But don't you place the blame on me
9234,"As you pour yourself another drink, yeah"
9235,I guess we are who we are
9236,"Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on"
9237,Maybe we took this too far
9238,"I went in headfirst, never thinkin' about who what I said hurt"
9239,"In what verse, my mom probably got it the worst"
9240,"The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are, did I take it too far?"
9241,"""Cleanin' Out My Closet"" and all them other songs"
9242,"But regardless, I don't hate you ‘cause, Ma"
9243,"You're still beautiful to me, ‘cause you're my mom"
9244,Though far be it from you to be calm
9245,"Our house was Vietnam, Desert Storm"
9246,And both of us put together could form an atomic bomb
9247,Equivalent to chemical warfare
9248,And forever we could drag this on and on
9249,"But agree to disagree, that gift for me"
9250,Up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me
9251,You're kickin' me out? It's 15 degrees
9252,"And it's Christmas Eve, ""Little prick, just leave!"""
9253,"Ma, let me grab my fucking coat!"
9254,Anything to have each other's goats
9255,Why we always at each other's throats?
9256,"Especially when Dad, he fucked us both"
9257,We're in the same fuckin' boat
9258,You'd think that'd make us close
9259,"Further away it drove us, but together, headlights shine"
9260,"And a car full of belongings, still got a ways to go"
9261,"Back to grandma's house, it's straight up the road"
9262,"And I was the man of the house, the oldest"
9263,So my shoulders carried the weight of the load
9264,Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old
9265,And that's when I realized you were sick
9266,And it wasn't fixable or changeable
9267,"And to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though, but—"
9268,I guess we are who we are
9269,"Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on"
9270,Maybe we took this too far
9271,"‘Cause to this day we remain estranged, and I hate it though"
9272,‘Cause you ain't even get to witness your grandbabies grow
9273,"But I'm sorry, Momma, for ""Cleanin' Out My Closet"""
9274,"At the time I was angry, rightfully? Maybe so"
9275,Never meant that far to take it though
9276,"‘Cause now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not makin' jokes"
9277,That song I no longer play at shows
9278,And I cringe every time it's on the radio
9279,And I think of Nathan being placed in a home
9280,And all the medicine you fed us and
9281,How I just wanted you to taste your own
9282,But now the medication's takin' over
9283,And your mental state's deterioratin' slow
9284,"And I'm way too old to cry, this shit is painful though"
9285,"But, Ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan, yo"
9286,"All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both"
9287,"Foster care, that cross you bear, few may be as heavy as yours"
9288,"But I love you, Debbie Mathers"
9289,"Oh, what a tangled web we have ‘cause"
9290,One thing I never asked was
9291,Where the fuck my deadbeat dad was
9292,"Fuck it, I guess he had trouble keepin' up with every address"
9293,"But I'da flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus"
9294,Owned a collection of maps
9295,And followed my kids to the edge of the atlas
9296,If someone ever moved 'em from me
9297,That you coulda bet your asses
9298,"If I had to come down the chimney, dressed as Santa, kidnap 'em"
9299,And although one has only met their grandma once
9300,You pulled up in our drive one night
9301,As we were leavin' to get some hamburgers
9302,"Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you"
9303,And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness
9304,Come over me as we pulled off to go our separate paths and
9305,I saw your headlights as I looked back
9306,And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to
9307,Thank you for being my mom and my dad
9308,"So, Mom, please accept this as a"
9309,"Tribute; I wrote this on the jet, I guess I had to"
9310,"Get this off my chest, I hope I get the chance to"
9311,"Lay it 'fore I'm dead, the stewardess said to fasten"
9312,"My seatbelt, I guess we're crashin'"
9313,"So, if I'm not dreamin', I hope you get this message that"
9314,"I will always love you from afar, ‘cause you're my mom"
9315,I guess we are who we are
9316,"Headlights shining in the dark night, I drive on"

9318,I want a new life
9319,One without a cause
9320,So I'm coming home tonight
9321,"Well, no matter what the cost"
9322,And if the plane goes down
9323,Or if the crew can't wake me up
9324,"Well, just know that I'm alright"
9325,I was not afraid to die
9326,"Oh, even if there's songs to sing"
9327,"Well, my children will carry me"
9328,Just know that I'm alright
9329,I was not afraid to die
9330,Because I put my faith in my little girls
9331,So I'll never say goodbye cruel world
9332,Just know that I'm alright
9333,I am not afraid to die
9334,I guess we are who we are

9338,This is survival of the fittest
9339,This is do or die
9340,This is the winner takes it all
9341,"So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all"
9342,"Wasn't ready to be no millionaire, I was ill-prepared"
9343,"I was prepared to be ill though, the skill was there"
9344,"From the beginning it wasn't 'bout the ends, it was 'bout"
9345,"Bustin' raps and standin' for somethin', fuck an acronym"
9346,"Cut the fuckin' act like you're happy, I'm fuckin' back again"
9347,With another anthem – why stop when it doesn't have to end?
9348,"It ain't over 'til I say it's over, enough when I say enough"
9349,"Throw me to them wolves and close the gate up, I'm afraid of What'll happen to them wolves when the thought of being thrown"
9350,"Into an alligator pit, I salivate at it, wait is up"

9356,This is do or die
9357,This is the winner takes it all
9358,"So, take it all, a-all, a-all, a-all"
9359,I can see the finish line with each line that I finish
9360,"I'm so close to my goals, I can almost pole vault over the goal post"
9361,"And if I don't got enough in the tank, maybe I can just siphon enough"
9362,"To fill up this last can, man, will I survive in this climate or what?"
9363,They said I was washed-up and got a bloodbath
9364,"I'm not a rapper, I'm an adapter: I can adjust"
9365,"Plus, I can just walk up to a mic and just bust"
9366,"So, floor's open if you'd like to discuss"
9367,"Top 5 in this muh'fucka, and if I don't make the cut"
9368,What? Like I give a fuck! I'ma light this bitch up like I'm driving a truck
9369,"Through the side of a pump, 0 to 60, hop in and gun it"
9370,"Like G-Unit without the hyphen, I'm hyping 'em up"
9371,And if there should ever come a time where my life's in a rut
9372,"And I look like I might just give up, eh, might've mistook"
9373,"Me for bowin' out, I ain't takin' a bow, I'm stabbin' myself"
9374,With a fuckin' knife in the gut while I'm wipin' my butt
9375,'Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like gettin' cut

9377,"'Cause I'ma fight 'til I die or win, bitin' the dust"
9378,"It'll just make me angrier; wait, let me remind you of what"
9379,"Got me this far, picture me quittin'"
9380,"Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it, slut!"

9394,"As soon as I get thrown in a booth, I spit"
9395,"But my respect is overdue, I'm showin' you the flow no one do"
9396,"'Cause I don't own no diploma for school, I quit"
9397,"So there's nothin' for me to fall back on, I know no other trade"
9398,So you better trade your fuckin' mics in for some tool-box-es
9399,"'Cause you'll never take my pride from me, it'll have to be pried from me"
9400,"So, pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers!"
9401,"But I want you to doubt me, I don't want you to buh-lieve"
9402,'Cause this is somethin' that I must use to succeed
9403,"And if you don't like me, then fuck you! Self-esteem"
9404,"Must be fuckin' shootin' through the roof, 'cause trust me"
9405,My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me
9406,"I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be"
9407,"Allergic to failure, 'cause everytime I come close to it"

9425,"I'm rollin' Sweets, I'm smokin' sour"
9426,"Married to the game, but she broke her vows"
9427,That's why my bars are full of broken bottles
9428,And my nightstands are full of open Bibles
9429,"Uh, I think about more than I forget"
9430,But I don't go around fire expectin' not to sweat
9431,"And these niggas know I lay 'em down, make your bed"

9484,'Bout to spit the greatest verse of all time
9485,"So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and, um"
9486,Scribble out them rhymes you were gonna spit
9487,And start over from scratch and write new ones
9488,But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference
9489,When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight
9490,It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump
9491,"From the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow"
9492,Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd
9493,You can see the sparks from hot metal
9494,"Cold-hearted, from the day I Bogarted"

9496,When I'm not even in my harshest
9497,"You can still get roasted, ‘cause Marsh is not mellow"
9498,"'Til I'm topplin' from the top, I'm not gonna stop"

9560,From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he's still shittin'
9561,"Whether he's on salary, paid hourly"
9562,Until he bows out or he shits his bowels out of him
9563,"Whichever comes first, for better or worse"
9564,He's married to the game
9565,"Like a ""fuck you"" for Christmas, his gift is a curse"

9578,For you to know it's a rap
9579,"You said you was king, you lied through your teeth"
9580,"For that, fuck your feelings"
9581,"Instead of gettin' crowned, you're gettin' capped"
9582,"And to the fans, I'll never let you down again, I'm back"
9583,I promise to never go back on that promise
9584,"In fact, let's be honest, that last Relapse CD was ""ehh"""
9585,Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground
9586,"Relax, I ain't goin' back to that now"
9587,"All I'm tryin' to say is get back, click-clack-blaow"
9588,'Cause I ain't playin' around
9589,There's a game called circle and I don't know how

9592,"Thought I had it mapped out, but I guess I didn't"
9593,This fuckin' black cloud still follows me around

9609,"I've had enough, now I’m so fed up"
9610,Time to put my life back together right now
9611,"It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me"
9612,Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you
9613,So I could come back a brand-new me
9614,You helped see me through
9615,"And don't even realize what you did, believe me you"
9616,I've been through the wringer
9617,But they can do little to the middle finger
9618,"I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of"
9619,"My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers"
9620,And drop dead: no more beef lingers
9621,"No more drama from now on, I promise"
9622,To focus solely on handlin' my responsibilities as a father
9623,So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters
9624,"And raise it, you couldn't lift a single shingle on it"
9625,"'Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club"
9626,Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up
9627,'Cause I'm raisin' the bar
9628,"I'd shoot for the moon, but I'm too busy gazin' at stars"

9641,Eat a fuckin’ dick
9642,I'm feelin' like the greatest
9643,On the beat who ever did it
9644,Mike WiLL the one who made it
9645,It's Shady on the lyrics
9646,I'm somewhat outlandish they say
9647,You say we're cut from the same cloth
9648,"But I guess you fabricate, eh?"
9649,You better bring more men than the Latter Day Saints
9650,"Manic states, Stephen Paddock with automatic stay sprayin'"
9651,At anything that may stand in they way
9652,As I stand at the bay window with a hand grenade
9653,"And a trey eight, at the Mandalay Bay"
9654,"Common sense, I'm a dollar short and a day late"
9655,James Holmes at the Saturday Batman matinee
9656,Must have missed my CAT scan that day

9659,"I’m turnin’ back to a madman, can't take"
9660,Anymore but I try to get away from the anger and rage
9661,My basal ganglia’s an A to the K
9662,Get your ass sprayed like bidets
9663,"Breakin' your legs eight different ways, ankle to waist"
9664,You chumps don't even know how to do somethin'
9665,To give goosebumps a day when you say
9666,That somethin’ you wrote gave someone a lump in their throat
9667,"Or you had them choked up, you'd be yankin' my chain"
9668,"Feelin' like I'm headed for the padded cell, the"
9669,Bar for me when I rap isn't fair but
9670,Guess that's the standard I'm held to
9671,But if somethin' like that doesn't tell ya
9672,You set a mark too high when platinum sales are
9673,Looked at as a failure
9674,Then you better take it back to The Shelter and Hamburger Helper
9675,"'Cause, damn it, I'm still the"
9676,"Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world"
9677,"No lie, I might be"
9678,"The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it"
9679,I feel like the greatest

9681,"Never be as good, never be as good"
9682,"Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white"
9683,But I'm the greatest
9684,"So you sold ten million albums, eh?"
9685,"Only problem is, you put out ten million albums, eh?"
9686,What was I just about to say?
9687,"Oh yeah, let me get this out the way"
9688,I know there's people that are pissed about the way
9689,"I mispronounced a name, ""DIE ANTWOORD!"""
9690,"Fuck, I still can't say this shit, but how quickly they forget"
9691,Who the fuck I was; now Ninja try to duck my slugs
9692,You let ya girl get fucked by Muggs
9693,I'd like to give a shout to Cypress
9694,"This can't be real, you dissed me and I was just tryin' to"
9695,Give you a shout—now get the fuck out my rhyme book
9696,"No more shiners, already too much time took"
9697,And rappers I hear you talkin' shit
9698,I'm just too big to respond to it
9699,"God forbid I forget, go and jump out the window"
9700,Somebody better child-proof it
9701,'Cause if I lose it we can rewind to some old Ja Rule shit
9702,And I can remind motherfuckers how I do shit
9703,You don't got the tools I got in my toolkit
9704,"I bullshit you not, y'all fools just forgot"
9705,That I'm so fuckin' awful with the thoughts
9706,And when I'm hostile and impossible to stop
9707,So you can call it a nostril 'cause it's not gonna ever

9719,"Oh yeah, and one more thing I want to mention"
9720,Is you're one dimension
9721,I'm a monkey wrench and I can flunk detention
9722,"And I love contentions, so welcome to the gun convention"
9723,"Muscles flexin', gotta strut like a front suspension"
9724,And you just stuck the key up in the ignition
9725,And gave me enough gas to flood my engine
9726,"Psychopath, Michael Jack's blowin' up like a raft"
9727,I should slap Vlad with a ISIS flag
9728,Bet you I come back twice as bad
9729,Revival didn't go viral!
9730,Denaun and Royce tell me that I should take the high road

9739,"Float like a butterfly, I'm gonna sting like a bee"
9740,You ain't harmin' a thing
9741,I hit a ding hard as I'm gonna swing
9742,I'm gonna need to put my arm in a sling
9743,But like a wedding band
9744,You gotta be diamond to even climb in the ring
9745,"Anomaly, I'm Muhammad Ali"
9746,'Cause I knew one day  I'm gonna be the
9747,"Greatest in the world, greatest in the world, greatest in the world"
9748,"No lie, I might be"
9749,"The best to ever do it, the best to ever do it, the best to ever do it"
9750,I feel like the greatest
9751,Woke up to honkies sounding like me
9752,"Never be as good, never be as good"
9753,"Packing up wife-beaters, white t-shirts, white"
9754,But I'm the greatest
9755,Lately I've been hard to reach
9756,I've been too long on my own
9757,Everybody has a private world
9758,Where they can be alone
9759,Are you calling me?
9760,Are you trying to get through?
9761,Are you reaching out for me?
9762,Then I'm reaching out for you
9763,I'm just so fuckin' depressed
9764,I just can't seem to get out this slump
9765,If I could just get over this hump
9766,But I need somethin' to pull me out this dump
9767,"I took my bruises, took my lumps"
9768,Fell down and I got right back up
9769,But I need that spark to get psyched back up
9770,In order for me to pick the mic back up
9771,I don't know how or why or when
9772,I ended up in this position I'm in
9773,I'm starting to feel distant again
9774,So I decided just to pick this pen
9775,Up and try to make an attempt to vent
9776,But I just can't admit
9777,Or come to grips with the fact that I may be done with rap
9778,I need a new outlet
9779,And I know some shit's so hard to swallow
9780,But I just can't sit back and wallow
9781,"In my own sorrow, but I know one fact:"
9782,I'll be one tough act to follow
9783,"One tough act to follow, I'll be one tough act to follow"
9784,"Here today, gone tomorrow"
9785,But you'd have to walk a thousand miles—
9786,"In my shoes, just to see"
9787,What it's like to be me
9788,"I'll be you, let's trade shoes"
9789,Just to see what it'd be like to
9790,"Feel your pain, you feel mine"
9791,Go inside each other's minds
9792,Just to see what we find
9793,Look at shit through each other's eyes
9794,But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
9795,"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you"
9796,Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
9797,"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you"
9798,I think I'm starting to lose my sense of humor
9799,Everything's so tense and gloom
9800,I almost feel like I gotta check the temperature
9801,"Of the room, just as soon as"
9802,"I walk in, it's like all eyes on me"
9803,So I try to avoid any eye contact
9804,"‘Cause if I do that, then it opens a door"
9805,For conversation like I want that
9806,I'm not lookin' for extra attention
9807,I just wanna be just like you
9808,Blend in with the rest of the room
9809,Maybe just point me to the closest restroom
9810,I don't need no fuckin' man servant
9811,Tryna follow me around and wipe my ass
9812,Laugh at every single joke I crack
9813,"And half of 'em ain't even funny, like, ""Ha!"
9814,"Marshall, you're so funny, man"
9815,"You should be a comedian, goddamn!"""
9816,Unfortunately I am
9817,I just hide behind the tears of a clown
9818,So why don't you all sit down?
9819,Listen to the tale I'm about to tell
9820,"Hell, we don't gotta trade our shoes"
9821,And you ain't gotta walk no thousand miles—
9822,"In my shoes, just to see"
9823,What it's like to be me
9824,"I'll be you, let's trade shoes"
9825,Just to see what it'd be like to
9826,"Feel your pain, you feel mine"
9827,Go inside each other's minds
9828,Just to see what we find
9829,Look at shit through each other's eyes
9830,But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
9831,"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you"
9832,Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
9833,"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you"
9834,Nobody asked for life to deal us
9835,With these bullshit hands we're dealt
9836,We gotta take these cards ourselves
9837,"And flip 'em, don't expect no help"
9838,"Now, I could've either just sat on my ass and pissed and moaned"
9839,Or take this situation in which I'm placed in
9840,And get up and get my own
9841,I was never the type of kid to wait by the door and pack his bags
9842,And sat on the porch and hoped and prayed
9843,For a dad to show up who never did
9844,"I just wanted to fit in in every single place, every school I went"
9845,I dreamed of being that cool kid
9846,Even if it meant acting stupid
9847,Aunt Edna always told me:
9848,"""Keep making that face, it'll get stuck like that."""
9849,"Meanwhile, I'm just standin' there"
9850,"Holdin' my tongue, tryin' to talk like this"
9851,'Til I stuck my tongue on that frozen stop sign pole at 8 years old
9852,I learned my lesson then
9853,‘Cause I wasn't tryin' to impress my friends no mo'
9854,But I already told you my whole life story
9855,Not just based on my description
9856,‘Cause where you see it from where you're sittin'
9857,It's probably 110% different
9858,I guess we would have to walk a mile in each other's shoes at least
9859,What size you wear? I wear 10's
9860,Let's see if you can fit your feet—
9861,"In my shoes, just to see"
9862,What it's like to be me
9863,"I'll be you, let's trade shoes"
9864,Just to see what it'd be like to
9865,"Feel your pain, you feel mine"
9866,Go inside each other's minds
9867,Just to see what we find
9868,Look at shit through each other's eyes
9869,But don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
9870,"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you"
9871,Don't let 'em say you ain't beautiful
9872,"They can all get fucked, just stay true to you"
9873,Lately I've been hard to reach
9874,I've been too long on my own
9875,Everybody has a private world
9876,Where they can be alone
9877,Are you calling me?
9878,Are you trying to get through?
9879,Are you reaching out for me?
9880,Then I'm reaching out for you
9881,"Yeah, to my babies: stay strong"
9882,Daddy'll be home soon
9883,And to the rest of the world: God gave you them shoes to fit you
9884,"So put 'em on and wear 'em, be yourself, man"
9885,"Be proud of who you are, even if it sounds corny"
9886,Never let no one tell you you ain't beautiful
9887,"Something's burnin', I can't figure out what"
9888,It's either lust or a cloud of dust
9889,Judgement is clouded; must
9890,Just be the powder from the power of
9891,But I'm in something I don't know how to get out of
9892,Left my girl in the house alone
9893,Is that my soon-to-be-spouse’s moan?
9894,"And the further I walk, the louder"
9895,Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
9896,"‘Cause after all, this is her place"
9897,"So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I"
9898,"Think I might be about to bust her, bust her"
9899,"The thought's scary, yo, though and it hurts—brace!"
9900,"Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo!"""
9901,‘Cause my head already goes to worst-case
9902,"Scenario, though in the first place"
9903,But you confirmed my low-end theory though
9904,Should've known when I made it all the way to third base
9905,And that was only the first date
9906,Could've made it to home plate
9907,But you slid straight for the dome and dove face first
9908,"""No,  you don't  under—  —stand,"
9909,"I  don't  do this for  anyone,  ever ."""
9910,"Yeah, that ain't what they all say?"
9911,"I'll say, you can suck a softball through a straw"
9912,Used to be my fiancé
9913,"'Til you sucked on Wayne, André, and Kanye"
9914,"LeBron, Akon, Jay, Lil Jon, Raekwon, Ma$e"
9915,"Polow da Don, Dre, Dante Ross, James Conway, Kwamé"
9916,"Guess I'm gettin' my g-goddang Jigga on, eh?"
9917,"‘Cause your name, I'm beyond sayin'"
9918,"But fuck it, I'm movin' on, you women are all cray"
9919,But I'll probably always keep on playin' the—
9920,"Game of love, love, love, love"
9921,La-la-la-la-la love
9922,"She doesn't love me, no, she don't love me no more"
9923,"She hates my company, guess she don't love me no more"
9924,"I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door"
9925,She screamed she loved me like she never did before
9926,"And I told her, ""Go where you wanna!"
9927,"Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"""
9928,"And I told her, ""Go where you wanna!"
9929,"Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"""
9930,"I told that bitch, ""I'm a sucker for love, you a sucker for dick."""
9931,"Suckin' dick in your mama tub, then your granny walked in"
9932,Told the stupid nigga to duck under the water
9933,"He drowned, like an abortion"
9934,They booked you for manslaughter
9935,You beat the case and I called ya
9936,"""Sherane is not available now, leave a message at the tone"
9937,"And Kendrick, don't forget to buy two pair of those"
9938,"Expensive heels, you little fuckin' Ferris wheel"
9939,"Fuckin' spinnin' on me—fuck you think, we gon' get married still?"
9940,"Fuckin' Mary had a little lamb, this ain't no fairy tale"
9941,Fairy godmama better tell you how I fuckin' feel
9942,Like you should fuckin' beat it
9943,Or fuckin' eat it while I'm on my period
9944,"Now have a blessed day.""  Bitch, you serious?"
9945,"I'm in the mirror with this look on my face, curious"
9946,"Why you ain't fuckin' with me, you cut me deep as Caesarean"
9947,"You know I want you bad as a Benjamin, I'm delirious"
9948,I want you bad as the head shattered on George Zimmerman
9949,After the Dillinger hit him diligently and killin' him
9950,His mouthpiece for a Cadillac emblem
9951,That's analogy and metaphor for you
9952,I should win a medal for all the ways I adore you
9953,"This is me talkin' cordial, yeah, I got some home training"
9954,"That ain't what you like, ain't it?"
9955,What about if I was as famous as Marshall?
9956,Would you give fellatio in the carpool?
9957,"Cops pull us over, they just wanna know if you gargle"
9958,"Singin', ""I hope she's good enough"
9959,"Meanwhile you're chasin' her"""
9960,Chlamydia couldn't even get rid of her
9961,"Pity the fool and pity the fool in me, I'ma live with the—"
9962,"Game of love, love, love, love"
9963,La-la-la-la-la love
9964,]
9965,"I tried to get her up out of my head, left my bags at the door"
9966,She screamed she loved me like she never did before
9967,"And I told her, ""Go where you wanna!"
9968,"Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"""
9969,"And I told her, ""Go where you wanna!"
9970,"Go do whatcha wanna do, I don't care!"""
9971,So needless to say I'm feelin' betrayed
9972,Snatch my house key off her key chain
9973,She jumps off Wee-Bey from The Wire's dick
9974,Now she's chasin' me with a cheese grater
9975,Here goes that broken record cliché
9976,"It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break"
9977,"She treats my face like Serato, she cuts and scratches like a DJ"
9978,Each day is an Instant Replay
9979,They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behavior
9980,"Back together, but forgot today was her B-day"
9981,She cut me off on the freeway
9982,"Simple misunderstanding, but just as I went to slam on the brakes"
9983,"That's when I realized that she may be crazy as me, wait"
9984,Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
9985,Stepped on them fuckers eight times
9986,"Still goin' 73, thank God there's an exit comin' up"
9987,What the mother-F-U-C-K's wrong with her?
9988,Hit the off ramp 'til I coasted to a goshdamn halt
9989,"Hit a fuckin' tree, now here she comes at full speed"
9990,"She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?"
9991,Snatch that bitch out her car through the window
9992,"She screamin', I body slam her on the cement"
9993,Until the concrete gave and created a sinkhole
9994,"Buried the stink ho in it, then paid to have the street repaved"
9995,Woke up in a dream state
9996,In a cold sweat like I got hit with a freeze ray during a heat wave
9997,"Guess I eventually caved though, ‘cause she's layin' next to me in bed—directly aimin' a gat at my head!"
9998,Woke up again and jumped up
9999,"Like, ""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab."""
10000,"I confess I'm a static addict, I guess that's why I'm so clingy"
10001,Every girl I've ever had either says I got too much baggage
10002,Or I'm too fuckin' dramatic
10003,"Man, what the fuck is the matter? I'm just a fuckin' romantic"
10004,"I fuckin' love you, you fuckin' bitch!"
10005,"Combative, possessive, in fact last time I was mad at an ex"
10006,I actually set off a chain reaction of tragic events
10007,"I said, ""Hit the road"", then after she left"
10008,"I sent that bitch a text that said, ""Be careful driving"
10009,"Don't read this and have an accident"""
10010,She glanced to look at it and wrecked
10011,"Too bad, thought we had a connect"
10012,"No sense dwelling makes, never been a more compelling case"
10013,Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
10014,Who fell from grace 11 stories for storytellin'
10015,"While the whore was yellin', ""Rape!"""
10016,'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
10017,And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
10018,Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
10019,To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
10020,"'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though"
10021,"You're late, well, the sentiment's great"
10022,"But wait, think there's been a mistake"
10023,"You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate"
10024,I have infinite hate in my blood
10025,It's mainly 'cause of the game of—
10026,"Wait, ""dinner at eight""? I have infinite hate in my blood"
10027,It's mainly 'cause of the—
10028,"Game of love, love, love, love"
10029,La-la-la-la-la love
10030,I'm on that good kush and alcohol
10031,I got some down bitches I can call

10040,Lil Tunechi got that fire
10041,"And these hoes love me like Satan, man"
10042,"Yeah, fuck with me and get bodied"
10043,And all she eat is dick
10044,"She's on a strict diet, that's my baby"
10045,"With no makeup, she a ten"
10046,And she the best with that head
10047,Even better than Karrine
10048,She don't want money
10049,She want the time that we could spend
10050,"She said, ""'Cause I really need somebody"
10051,"So tell me you're that somebody"""
10052,"Girl, I fuck who I want, and fuck who I don't"
10053,"Got that A1 credit, that's that filet mignon"
10054,"She said, ""I never want to make you mad"
10055,"I just want to make you proud"""
10056,"I said, ""Baby, just make me cum"
10057,"Then don't make a sound"""
10058,Slick Tunechi
10059,I'm on that good kush and alcohol
10060,I got some down bitches I can call

10067,Long as these bitches love me
10068,"Uh, real nigga, fuck these haters"
10069,These hoes got pussies like craters
10070,"Can't treat these hoes like ladies, man"
10071,"Pussy, money, weed, codeine"
10072,She said my dick feel like morphine
10073,I hope my name taste like sardines to these niggas
10074,"She wake up, eat this dick"
10075,"Call that breakfast in bed, 69, 96"
10076,"I feel her heartbeat, I chest-to-chest with this bitch"
10077,"Now turn around, face down; I'm arrestin' this bitch"
10078,"Yeah, all my bitches love me, and I love all my bitches"
10079,"But it's like as soon as I cum, I come to my senses"
10080,And I would say these hoes' names
10081,But then I would be snitchin'
10082,And these haters try to knock me
10083,But they can't knock me off the hinges
10084,Lil Tunechi

13001,Whole time they wanna take my place
13002,Whole time they wanna take my place
13003,"Yeah, I know they wanna take my place"
13004,I can tell that love is fake
13005,I don't trust a word you say
13006,How you wanna clique up after your mistakes?

13021,"With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love"
13022,You shouldn't have to deal with that
13023,"I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause..."

13028,So what are you?
13029,"What are you, what are you so afraid of?"
13030,"Darling, you"
13031,You give but you cannot take love
13032,"Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive"
13033,"Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance"
13034,"I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping"
13035,I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
13036,Started realizing a couple places I could take it
13037,I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
13038,"I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation"
13039,And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
13040,"I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience"
13041,Just me and my old man getting back to basics
13042,We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
13043,"When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing"
13044,"Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas"
13045,"We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us"
13046,We even talked about you and our couple of moments
13047,He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
13048,"You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone"
13049,Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
13050,My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
13051,Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
13052,You don't even know what you want from love anymore
13053,I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
13054,"But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?"
13055,"Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?"
13056,I love me
13057,I love me enough for the both of us

13062,"Darling, you"
13063,You give but you cannot take love
13064,"Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures"
13065,"Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage"
13066,When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
13067,"A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it"
13068,'Cause that night I played her three songs
13069,Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
13070,Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
13071,"Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off"
13072,Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
13073,Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
13074,Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
13075,When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
13076,The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
13077,I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
13078,"Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?"
13079,"Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't"
13080,Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
13081,"Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision"
13082,Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
13083,"When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven"
13084,It seem like you don't want this love anymore
13085,"I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore"
13086,"But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?"
13087,"Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?"
13088,I love me
13089,I love me enough for the both of us
13090,That's why you trust me
13091,I know you been through more than most of us

13178,Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant
13179,They ain't movin' at all
13180,"But when they need a favor, who do they call?"
13181,Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems
13182,Askin' what was said and who was involved
13183,Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong
13184,"They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on"
13185,These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em
13186,Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough
13187,I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em
13188,"'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'"
13189,No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air
13190,"Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?"
13191,They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care

We had the champagne in the studio, of course—compliments of the company—and we just laid back and did it. So we hope you enjoy listening to this album half as much as we enjoyed playing it for you. Because we had a ball. Only real music is gonna last—all the other bullshit is here today and gone tomorrow..."

22039,"It's beauty in the struggle, ugliness in the success"
22040,Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
22041,I grew up in the city and know sometimes we had less
22042,Compared to some of my niggas
22043,"Down the block, man, we were blessed"
22044,"And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time"
22045,But I be goddamned if a nigga don't be tryin'

22120,All in your mind with fears that would come true
22121,"The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you"

22315,Look in my eyes and see the future
22316,But don't sugar coat it
22317,Listen...
22318,History repeats itself and that's just how it goes
22319,Same way that these rappers always bite each others flows
22320,Same thing that my nigga Elvis did with Rock n Roll
22321,"Justin Timberlake, Eminem and then Macklemore"
22322,While silly niggas argue over who gon' snatch the crown
22323,"Look around, my nigga, white people have snatched the sound"
22324,This year I’ll prolly go to the awards dappered down
22325,Watch Iggy win a Grammy as I try to crack a smile
22326,"I'm just playin', but all good jokes contain true shit"
22327,"Same rope you climb up on, they'll hang you with"
22328,"But not Jermaine, my aim too sick"
22329,"I bang nigga, I came to bring the pain my brain too quick"
22330,"You see how I maneuver this game, I ain't stupid"
22331,"I recognize that life is a dream, and I dream lucid"
22332,And break the chains and change minds
22333,"One verse at a time, and claim 2-6"
22334,"And fuck it, if the shoe fits, who's the king?"
22335,We all kings
22336,Kings of ourselves first and foremost
22337,While the people debate who's the king of this rap game
22338,Here comes lil' ol' Jermaine
22339,With every ounce of strength in his veins
22340,To snatch the crown from whoever y'all think has it
22341,But rather than place it on his head as soon as he grabs it
22342,"Poof, boom, paow, it's like magic"
22343,With a flash and a BANG the crown disintegrates
22344,And falls to the Earth from which it came
22345,It's done
22346,Ain't gonna be no more kings
22347,Be wary of any man that claims
22348,Because deep down he clings onto the need for power
22349,"The reality, he's a coward"
22350,Ultimately he's scared to die
22351,And sometimes so am I
22352,But when I'm in tune with the most high
22353,"I realize, the fear lies in my lack of awareness of the other side"
22354,"Today I know that we are the same, are the same, you and I"
22355,"Different kind of skin, different set of eyes"
22356,"Two different minds, but only one God"
22357,It's for all the kings
22358,'Cause I know deep down every poet just wanna be loved
22359,Yeah
22360,For your eyes only
22361,"For your eyes only, for your eyes only"
22362,For your eyes only
22363,"Hey, niggas be dying on the daily"
22364,It seems my dreams faded for far too long
22365,The consequences deadly
22366,Can't visualize myself as nothing but a criminal
22367,"Control the block, serving up rocks and stay subliminal"
22368,"'Cause young niggas is hardheaded, they letting off"
22369,"Full of adrenaline, ignorant to what death can cause"
22370,"Ain't no coming back, family dressed in black"
22371,"Plus it's hot now, the cops outside, it's hard to flip a pack"
22372,"And my daughter gotta eat, her mama be stressing me"
22373,Like I ain't the one who put them Jays on her feet
22374,Like I ain't out in the field like that
22375,I might be low for the moment but I will bounce back
22376,"Despite the charges, back to the wall, I fight regardless"
22377,"Screaming, ""Fuck the law,"" my life is lawless"
22378,"That's what you call it, ain't got to be no psychic"
22379,To see this is like the farthest thing from heaven
22380,This is hell and I don't mean that hyperbolic
22381,I try to find employment even if it's wiping toilets
22382,But these felonies be making life the hardest
22383,Resisting the temptation to run up and swipe a wallet
22384,"Or run up on your yard, snatch your daughter bike and pawn it"
22385,That's why I write this sonnet
22386,If the pressure get too much for me to take and I break
22387,Play this tape for my daughter and let her know my life is on it
22388,Let her know my life is on it
22389,For your eyes only
22390,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22391,"For your eyes, do you understand me?"
22392,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22393,"For your eyes, do you understand me?"
22394,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22395,"For your eyes, do you understand me?"
22396,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22397,For your eyes only
22398,You probably grown now so this song'll hit you
22399,"If you hearing this, unfortunately means"
22400,That I'm no longer with you in the physical
22401,Not even sure if I believe in God but because you still alive
22402,He got me praying that the spiritual is real
22403,"So I can be a part of you still, my pops was killed too"
22404,So I know how part of you feels
22405,"Maybe you hate me, maybe you miss me, maybe you spite me"
22406,"Life goes in cycles, maybe you'll date a nigga just like me"
22407,"I hope not, I'm tired of dope spots"
22408,And fiends that smoke rocks
22409,I've seen far too many niggas' hopes rot
22410,I'm writing this because me and the devil had a dance
22411,"Now I see death around the corner, 'pologizing in advance"
22412,Don't know if I ever had a chance
22413,"At a glance, I'm a failure"
22414,Addicted to pushing paraphernalia
22415,"But Daddy had dreams once, my eyes had a gleam once"
22416,Innocence disappeared by the age of eight years
22417,"My Pops shot up, drug-related, mama addicted"
22418,So Granny raised me in projects where thugs was hanging
22419,Blood was staining the concrete
22420,Older niggas I loved talked like they was above
22421,"Maintaining a timesheet, that's slow money"
22422,Picked up the family business by the age of 13
22423,Six years later was handed sentence
22424,'Round the same time is when you came in this world
22425,Me and your mama thinking:
22426,"""What the fuck we naming this girl?"""
22427,"I told her ""Nina,"" the prettiest name that I could think of"
22428,"For the prettiest thing my eyes had ever seen, I was 19"
22429,Took me two felonies to see the trap
22430,This crooked-ass system set for me
22431,And now I fear it's too late for me to ever be
22432,The one that set examples that was never set for me
22433,"I'm living fast, but not fast enough"
22434,'Cause karma keeps on catching up to me
22435,And if my past becomes the death of me
22436,I hope you understand
22437,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22438,"For your eyes, do you understand me?"
22439,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22440,"For your eyes, do you understand me?"
22441,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22442,"For your eyes, do you understand me?"
22443,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22444,For your eyes only
22445,"It's several ways I could've went out, too many to count"
22446,Was it the trigger happy crackers that the badges give clout?
22447,"Was it the young niggas, blasting frustrated"
22448,'Cause the cash running out?
22449,Niggas don't know how to act in a drought
22450,"See, baby girl, I realized"
22451,My definition of a real nigga was skewed
22452,My views misshaped by new mixtapes
22453,That confirmed the shit I learned in the streets was true
22454,That real niggas don't speak when they beef with you
22455,"They just pull up on your street, let the heat achoo"
22456,"And if a real nigga hungry, he gon' eat your food"
22457,"I was a fool, spent all my time ducking school, ducking cops"
22458,"Ducking rules, hugging blocks that don't love you"
22459,I pray you find a nigga with goals and point of views
22460,"Much broader than the corner, if not it's gon' corner you"
22461,"Into a box, where your son don't even know his pops"
22462,And the cyclical nature of doing time continues
22463,My worst fear is one day that you come home from school
22464,And see your father face while hearing 'bout tragedy on news
22465,I got the strangest feeling your daddy gonna lose his life soon
22466,And sadly if you're listening now it must mean it's true
22467,But maybe there's a chance that it's not
22468,And this album remains locked
22469,In a hard drive like valuable jewels
22470,And I can teach you this in person
22471,Like I'm teaching you to tie your own shoes
22472,I love you and I hope to God I don't lose you
22473,For your eyes only
22474,"For your eyes, for your eyes only"
22475,"For your eyes, for your eyes only"
22476,"For your eyes, do you understand?"
22477,For your eyes only
22478,"One day your daddy called me, told me he had a funny feeling"
22479,"What he'd been dealing with lately, he wasn't telling"
22480,"I tried to pick his brains, still he wasn't revealing"
22481,But I could feel the sense of panic in his voice
22482,"And it was chilling, he said:"
22483,"""Jermaine, I knew you since we was children"
22484,"I never asked for nothing, when times was hard"
22485,"I never had discussions with you, begging you to help me"
22486,I dealt with the repercussions of my actions
22487,I know you tried to steer me 'way from that shit
22488,"But that shit was in my blood, you know my life"
22489,"I know your momma, nigga, send my love"
22490,In case I never get a chance to speak again
22491,I won't forget the weekends spent sleeping at your crib
22492,That's the way I wished my family lived
22493,"But my granny crib was in the 'jects"""
22494,I had to interject like:
22495,"""Nigga, what you talking 'bout? Fuck is you getting at?"""
22496,"He said, ""Listen, I got no time to dive into descriptions"

27201,Nobody thought I knew what I was doing
27202,"Nobody believed, so nobody would walk me through it"

27228,But I'd rather grow up than to stay eighteen
27229,Life goes on and hopefully only great things
27230,Traveling the world and seeing shit that I ain't seen
27231,"Then, one day, I look at my reflection"
27232,And realize how I been actin' and how I been dressing

27244,"But you gotta learn to get out of what you're goin' through"""
27245,"Hurdles got jumped, mountains got climbed"

27253,The same nigga that told me I had a hit
27254,Charged me $300 to put it up in his mix
27255,Now suicide lookin' better than hittin' the lick
27256,'Cause the whole time they knew that I was livin' out my whip

27267,"Now, I'm running round my mansion doing shit with my kids"
27268,"But now, maybe my life is too sweet"

27271,"Like crabs up in the bucket, but y'all just got defeated"
27272,"And all these bitches, all just want my semen"

27278,"I got loss, I got loss"
27279,"Credit cards got swiped, money got tossed"
27280,"Hundred after hundred, dollar after dollar"
27281,"Drinking every kind of liquor, then that Molly got swallowed"
27282,I know I fucked up 'cause I'm a grown man
27283,"So now, I'm thinking like my old man"
27284,"He said ""You wanna make God laugh?"
27285,"Then look up in the sky and try and come up with your own plan"""
27286,"Now, I see my niggas just want me to win"
27287,But I won't have 'em if I keep disrespecting my friends
27288,"They been through it, say they know the feel"

28912,My mind is really distorted
28913,I find nothing but trouble in my life
28914,I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
28915,This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
28916,And last night was just another distraction
28917,Or a reaction of what we consider madness
28918,I know exactly what happened
28919,You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
28920,Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
28921,Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
28922,But the type of bullet that stuck
28923,"Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands"
28924,My plan's rather vindictive
28925,Everybody's a victim in my eyes
28926,When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
28927,And outside became pitch black
28928,"A demon glued to my back, whispering ""Get 'em!"""
28929,I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
28930,That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
28931,In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
28932,I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
28933,The life that I knew as a youngin
28934,In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
28935,When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
28936,Niggas like me never prosper

28944,Promise that you will sing about me
28945,I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
28946,"To settle down, my main concern"
28947,Promise that you will sing about me
28948,Promise that you will sing about me
28949,You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
28950,And called it Section.80
28951,"The message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby"""
28952,What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
28953,But doubted your ignorance
28954,How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
28955,Judgin' her past and shit?
28956,"Well, it's completely my future"
28957,Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
28958,And I'ma need that forty dollars
28959,"Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow"
28960,"In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed"
28961,"By a married man, and father of three"
28962,My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
28963,"Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's"
28964,He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
28965,This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
28966,"These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em"
28967,"See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em"
28968,"Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim"
28969,Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
28970,"Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'"
28971,"Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught"
28972,"Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed"
28973,"And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit"
28974,"My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain"
28975,If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
28976,I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
28977,"And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song"
28978,"'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own"
28979,"And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?"
28980,"A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight"
28981,I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
28982,"I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate"
28983,"And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'"
28984,I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
28985,You lyin' to these motherfuckers
28986,Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
28987,"You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga"
28988,"Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit..."
28989,When the lights shut off and it's my turn
28990,"To settle down, my main concern"
28991,Promise that you will sing about me
28992,Promise that you will sing about me
28993,I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
28994,"To settle down, my main concern"
28995,Promise that you will sing about me
28996,Promise that you will sing about me
28997,Sometimes I look in the mirror
28998,And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
28999,"If it's today, I hope I hear a"
29000,Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
29001,With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
29002,I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
29003,"The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance"
29004,"With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed"
29005,May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
29006,I suffer a lot
29007,And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
29008,I tie my stomach in knots
29009,And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
29010,My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
29011,"That can come about, ’cause the tongue is mighty powerful"
29012,And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
29013,Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
29014,Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
29015,"And you're right, your brother was a brother to me"
29016,And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
29017,In a direction to speak on somethin'
29018,That's realer than the TV screen
29019,"By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between"
29020,"Her personal life, I was like ""It need to be told"""
29021,Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
29022,Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
29023,"Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's"
29024,"I count lives, all on these songs"
29025,"Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong"
29026,"Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong"
29027,And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
29028,Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
29029,Promise that you will sing about me
29030,Promise that you will sing about me
29031,I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn

30429,"Ooh-oh, baby, are you listening?"
30430,Oh-oh
30431,When you say you love me
30432,Know I love you more

30438,When I'm crying out for you?
30439,"I'm scared, oh, so scared"
30440,But when you're near me
30441,I feel like I'm standing with an army
30442,Of men armed with weapons
30443,When you say you love me
30444,Know I love you more
30445,And when you say you need me
30446,Know I need you more

30466,I hopped off the plane at LAX
30467,With a dream and my cardigan
30468,Welcome to the land of fame excess
30469,Am I gonna fit in?
30470,"Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time"
30471,"Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign"
30472,This is all so crazy
30473,Everybody seems so famous
30474,My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
30475,Too much pressure and I'm nervous
30476,That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
30477,And a JAY-Z song was on
30478,And a JAY-Z song was on
30479,And a JAY-Z song was on
30480,So I put my hands up
30481,"They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away"
30482,"I'm noddin' my head like, yeah"
30483,"Movin' my hips like, yeah"
30484,"Got my hands up, they're playing my song"
30485,They know I'm gonna be okay
30486,"Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A."
30487,"Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A."
30488,Get to the club in my taxi cab
30489,Everybody's lookin' at me now
30490,"Like, ""Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?"
30491,"She gotta be from out of town"""
30492,So hard with my girls not around me
30493,It's definitely not a Nashville party
30494,'Cause all I see are stilettos
30495,I guess I never got the memo
30496,My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
30497,Too much pressure and I'm nervous
30498,That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
30499,And a Britney song was on
30500,And a Britney song was on
30501,And a Britney song was on
30502,So I put my hands up
30503,"They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away"
30504,"I'm noddin' my head like, yeah"
30505,"Movin' my hips like, yeah"
30506,"Got my hands up, they're playing my song"
30507,They know I'm gonna be okay
30508,"Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A."
30509,"Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A."
30510,Feel like hopping on a flight
30511,Back to my hometown tonight
30512,Something stops me every time
30513,The DJ plays my song and I feel alright
30514,So I put my hands up
30515,"They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away"
30516,"I'm noddin' my head like, yeah"
30517,"Movin' my hips like, yeah"

30520,"Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A."
30521,"Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A."
30522,So I put my hands up
30523,"They're playing my song, the butterflies fly away"
30524,"I'm noddin' my head like, 'yeah'"
30525,"Movin' my hips like, 'yeah'"
30526,"Got my hands up, they're playing my song"
30527,They know I'm gonna be okay
30528,"Yeah , it's a party in the U.S.A."
30529,"Yeah , it's a party in the U.S.A."
30530,I can almost see it
30531,"That dream I'm dreaming, but"
30532,There's a voice inside my head saying
30533,"""You'll never reach it"""
30534,Every step I'm taking
30535,"Every move I make feels lost, with no direction"
30536,My faith is shaken
30537,"But I, I gotta keep trying"
30538,Gotta keep my head held high
30539,There's always gonna be another mountain
30540,I'm always gonna wanna make it move
30541,Always gonna be an uphill battle
30542,Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
30543,Ain’t about how fast I get there
30544,Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
30545,It's the climb
30546,The struggles I'm facing
30547,The chances I'm taking
30548,"Sometimes might knock me down, but"
30549,"No, I'm not breaking"
30550,I may not know it
30551,"But these are the moments that I'm gonna remember most, yeah"
30552,Just gotta keep going
30553,"And I, I gotta be strong"
30554,"Just keep pushing on, 'cause..."
30555,There's always gonna be another mountain
30556,I'm always gonna wanna make it move
30557,Always gonna be an uphill battle
30558,Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose
30559,Ain’t about how fast I get there
30560,Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
30561,It's the climb
30562,There's always gonna be another mountain
30563,I'm always gonna wanna make it move
30564,Always gonna be an uphill battle
30565,Sometimes you're gonna have to lose
30566,Ain’t about how fast I get there
30567,Ain’t about what's waiting on the other side
30568,It's the climb
30569,Keep on moving
30570,Keep climbing
30571,"Keep the faith, baby"
30572,"It's all about, it's all about the climb"
30573,"Keep your faith, keep your faith"
30574,Woah-u-oh
30575,"Oh, you broke my heart"
30576,I told you I was weak for love
30577,But then you went around
30578,And did what you wanted to do
30579,"And now I'm cryin', cryin'"
30580,"Ooh, it seemed like everything was going fine"
30581,I found the love that I thought was gonna last
30582,But then I accidentally saw a few things in your cell
30583,I even LOL'd
30584,"Man, I should've known"
30585,Why? Why you're doing what you do?
30586,"You, you might as well just tell the honest truth"
30587,"See, I'm not really down with this"
30588,This ain't no texting shit
30589,"No, I ain't got no biz, but it is what it is"
30590,I don't really have much to say
30591,I was over it the second that I saw her name
30592,"I got two, ooh-ooh, letters for you"
30593,"One of them's ""F"" and the other one's ""U"""
30594,'Cause what you gotta do is go get yourself a clue
30595,"Only two, ooh-ooh, letters to choose"
30596,"One of them's ""F"" and the other one's ""U"""
30597,SMH
30598,"I'm pressing ""send"" on you"
30599,"Could've been this, could've been that"
30600,"We done been there, we done been back"
30601,"You ain't with it, could've said that"
30602,Why you tripping?
30603,Let me hit that
30604,I ain't trying to argue no more
30605,I do it all for you
30606,"You know you're my ride or die, baby, let me show you"
30607,"Oh, I know what's been goin' on"
30608,Don't even try to act like Mr. Super Nonchalant
30609,What makes you think I'll stick around?
30610,I'm not as stupid as you sound
30611,And you sound really dumb right now
30612,"From A to Zed, ooh-ah"
30613,I got a lot of nasty things floating up in my head
30614,But none of them are worth my time
30615,You're not even worth this rhyme
30616,"And I don't, I don't give a flying"
30617,I don't really have much to say
30618,I was over it the second that I saw her name

30626,]
30627,Letters for you
30628,What you trippin' on?
30629,"Girl, you know you wrong"
30630,"Don't let these girls drive you crazy, haan"
30631,I don't really have much to say
30632,I was over it the second that I saw her name

30638,SMH
30639,"I'm pressing ""send"" on you"
30640,We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
30641,"And this is our place, we make the rules"
30642,"And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear"
30643,Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
30644,Can I go where you go?
30645,Can we always be this close?
30646,"Forever and ever, ah"
30647,"Take me out, and take me home"
30648,"You're my, my, my, my lover"
30649,We could let our friends crash in the living room
30650,"This is our place, we make the call"
30651,And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
30652,"I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all"
30653,Can I go where you go?
30654,Can we always be this close?
30655,"Forever and ever, ah"
30656,"Take me out, and take me home"
30657,"You're my, my, my, my lover"
30658,"Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?"
30659,With every guitar string scar on my hand
30660,I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
30661,My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
30662,All's well that ends well to end up with you
30663,Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
30664,And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
30665,"And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover"
30666,Can I go where you go?
30667,Can we always be this close?
30668,"Forever and ever, ah"
30669,"Take me out, and take me home"
30670,"You're my, my, my, my"
30671,"Oh, you're my, my, my, my"
30672,"Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"
30673,"Vintage tee, brand new phone"
30674,High heels on cobblestones
30675,"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
30676,"Sequin smile, black lipstick"
30677,Sensual politics
30678,"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
30679,But I knew you
30680,Dancin' in your Levi's
30681,"Drunk under a streetlight, I"
30682,I knew you
30683,Hand under my sweatshirt
30684,"Baby, kiss it better, I"
30685,And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
30686,Under someone's bed
30687,You put me on and said I was your favorite
30688,A friend to all is a friend to none
30689,"Chase two girls, lose the one"
30690,"When you are young, they assume you know nothing"
30691,But I knew you
30692,Playing hide-and-seek and
30693,"Giving me your weekends, I"
30694,I knew you
30695,Your heartbeat on the High Line
30696,"Once in twenty lifetimes, I"
30697,And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
30698,Under someone's bed
30699,You put me on and said I was your favorite
30700,To kiss in cars and downtown bars
30701,Was all we needed
30702,You drew stars around my scars
30703,But now I'm bleedin'
30704,'Cause I knew you
30705,Steppin' on the last train
30706,"Marked me like a bloodstain, I"
30707,I knew you
30708,Tried to change the ending
30709,"Peter losing Wendy, I"
30710,I knew you
30711,Leavin' like a father
30712,"Running like water, I"
30713,"And when you are young, they assume you know nothing"
30714,But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
30715,I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
30716,The smell of smoke would hang around this long
30717,'Cause I knew everything when I was young
30718,I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
30719,Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
30720,I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
30721,And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
30722,And I knew you'd come back to me
30723,You'd come back to me
30724,And you'd come back to me
30725,And you'd come back
30726,And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
30727,Under someone's bed
30728,You put me on and said I was your favorite
30729,"I can see you standing, honey"
30730,With his arms around your body
30731,"Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all"
30732,And it took you five whole minutes
30733,To pack us up and leave me with it
30734,Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
30735,I think I've seen this film before
30736,And I didn't like the ending
30737,You're not my homeland anymore
30738,So what am I defending now?
30739,"You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out"
30740,I think I've seen this film before
30741,"Ooh, ooh, ooh"
30742,"I can see you starin', honey"
30743,Like he's just your understudy
30744,Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
30745,"Second, third, and hundredth chances"
30746,Balancin' on breaking branches
30747,Those eyes add insult to injury
30748,I think I've seen this film before
30749,And I didn't like the ending
30750,I'm not your problem anymore
30751,So who am I offending now?
30752,"You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out"
30753,I think I've seen this film before
30754,So I'm leaving out the side door
30755,"So step right out, there is no amount"
30756,Of crying I can do for you
30757,All this time
30758,We always walked a very thin line
30759,You didn't even hear me out
30760,You never gave a warning sign
30761,All this time
30762,I never learned to read your mind
30763,I couldn't turn things around
30764,'Cause you never gave a warning sign
30765,"So many signs, so many signs"
30766,You didn't even see the signs
30767,I think I've seen this film before
30768,And I didn't like the ending
30769,You're not my homeland anymore
30770,So what am I defending now?
30771,"You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out"
30772,I think I've seen this film before
30773,So I'm leavin' out the side door
30774,"So step right out, there is no amount"
30775,Of crying I can do for you
30776,All this time
30777,We always walked a very thin line
30778,You didn't even hear me out
30779,You never gave a warning sign
30780,All this time
30781,I never learned to read your mind
30782,I couldn't turn things around
30783,'Cause you never gave a warning sign
30784,You never gave a warning sign
30785,I never learned to read your mind
30786,I couldn't turn things around
30787,'Cause you never gave a warning sign
30788,You never gave a warning sign
30789,"Ah, ah"
30790,I don't like your little games
30791,Don't like your tilted stage
30792,The role you made me play
30793,"Of the fool, no, I don't like you"
30794,I don't like your perfect crime
30795,How you laugh when you lie
30796,You said the gun was mine
30797,"Isn't cool, no, I don't like you"
30798,"But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time"
30799,"Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time"
30800,"I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined"
30801,"I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!"
30802,"Ooh, look what you made me do"
30803,Look what you made me do
30804,Look what you just made me do
30805,Look what you just made me—
30806,"Ooh, look what you made me do"
30807,Look what you made me do
30808,Look what you just made me do
30809,Look what you just made me do
30810,I don't like your kingdom keys
30811,They once belonged to me
30812,You asked me for a place to sleep
30813,Locked me out and threw a feast
30814,"The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama"
30815,"But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma"
30816,"And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure"
30817,"Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours"
30818,"But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time"
30819,"Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time"
30820,"I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined"

30864,"Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no"""
30865,"I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though"
30866,I hit the ground running each night
30867,I hit the Sunday matinée
30868,You know the greatest films of all time were never made
30869,"I guess you never know, never know"
30870,"And if you wanted me, you really should've showed"
30871,"And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow"
30872,And it's alright now
30873,"But we were something, don't you think so?"
30874,"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool"
30875,And if my wishes came true
30876,It would've been you
30877,"In my defense, I have none"
30878,For never leaving well enough alone
30879,But it would've been fun
30880,If you would've been the one
30881,I have this dream you're doing cool shit
30882,Having adventures on your own
30883,You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
30884,"We never painted by the numbers, baby"
30885,But we were making it count
30886,You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
30887,"I guess you never know, never know"
30888,And it's another day waking up alone
30889,"But we were something, don't you think so?"
30890,"Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool"
30891,And if my wishes came true
30892,It would've been you
30893,"In my defense, I have none"
30894,For never leaving well enough alone
30895,But it would've been fun
30896,If you would've been the one
30897,"I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you"
30898,If one thing had been different
30899,Would everything be different today?
30900,"We were something, don't you think so?"
30901,Rosé flowing with your chosen family
30902,And it would've been sweet
30903,If it could've been me
30904,"In my defense, I have none"
30905,For digging up the grave another time
30906,But it would've been fun
30907,If you would've been the one
30908,I wanna be your end game
30909,I wanna be your first string
30910,I wanna be your A-Team
30911,"I wanna be your end game, end game"
30912,"Big reputation, big reputation"

30921,"We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin’ a boat"
30922,"I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me"
30923,I'm one call away whenever you need me
30924,"I'm in a G5 , come to the A-Side"
30925,"I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like"
30926,"You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type"
30927,You hold me down and I protect you with my life
30928,"I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be"
30929,Just another ex-love you don’t wanna see
30930,I don’t wanna miss you
30931,Like the other girls do
30932,"I don’t wanna hurt you, I just wanna be"
30933,Drinking on a beach with you all over me

30939,"I wanna be your end game, end game"
30940,"Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older"
30941,"Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders"
30942,"Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep"
30943,"The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me"
30944,"Even when we’d argue, we'd not do it for long"
30945,And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
30946,"For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease"
30947,"For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities"
30948,"I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny"
30949,"After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July"
30950,"I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one"
30951,"With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it"
30952,"I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be"
30953,Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
30954,I don't wanna miss you
30955,Like the other girls do
30956,"I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be"
30957,Drinking on a beach with you all over me

30970,"And I heard about you, ooh"
30971,"You like the bad ones, too"
30972,"I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't"
30973,"And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em"
30974,"Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy"
30975,"I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me"
30976,"And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul"
30977,"It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold"
30978,You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
30979,So here's the truth from my red lips

30987,"I wanna be your end game, end game"
30988,You are somebody that I don't know
30989,But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
30990,"And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM"
30991,"Say it in the street, that's a knock-out"
30992,"But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out"
30993,"And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?"""
30994,And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
30995,But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
30996,And snakes and stones never broke my bones
30997,"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
30998,"You need to calm down, you're being too loud"
30999,"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
31000,"You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?"
31001,You need to calm down
31002,You are somebody that we don't know
31003,But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
31004,Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
31005,Sunshine on the street at the parade
31006,But you would rather be in the dark ages
31007,Makin' that sign must've taken all night
31008,You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
31009,And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
31010,'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
31011,"So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
31012,"You need to calm down, you're being too loud"
31013,"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
31014,"You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?"
31015,You need to calm down
31016,And we see you over there on the internet
31017,Comparing all the girls who are killing it
31018,But we figured you out
31019,We all know now we all got crowns
31020,You need to calm down
31021,"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
31022,You need to calm down
31023,You're being too loud
31024,"And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh"
31025,You need to just stop
31026,Like can you just not step on our gowns?
31027,You need to calm down
31028,I promise that you'll never find another like me
31029,"I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh"
31030,I know I never think before I jump
31031,And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
31032,I know that I went psycho on the phone
31033,I never leave well enough alone
31034,And trouble's gonna follow where I go
31035,But one of these things is not like the others
31036,Like a rainbow with all of the colors
31037,"Baby doll, when it comes to a lover"
31038,I promise that you'll never find another like
31039,"Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"
31040,I'm the only one of me
31041,"Baby, that's the fun of me"
31042,"Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh"

31044,"Baby, that's the fun of you"
31045,And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e
31046,I know I tend to make it about me
31047,I know you never get just what you see
31048,"But I will never bore you, baby"
31049,And when we had that fight out in the rain
31050,You ran after me and called my name
31051,I never wanna see you walk away
31052,'Cause one of these things is not like the others
31053,"Livin' in winter, I am your summer"
31054,"Baby doll, when it comes to a lover"
31055,I promise that you'll never find another like

31088,"About why you switched your homeroom, but"
31089,I think it's 'cause of me
31090,"Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard"
31091,When I passed your house
31092,It's like I couldn't breathe
31093,You heard the rumors from Inez
31094,You can't believe a word she says
31095,"Most times, but this time it was true"
31096,The worst thing that I ever did
31097,Was what I did to you
31098,But if I just showed up at your party
31099,Would you have me? Would you want me?
31100,Would you tell me to go fuck myself
31101,Or lead me to the garden?
31102,"In the garden, would you trust me"
31103,If I told you it was just a summer thing?
31104,"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
31105,But I know I miss you
31106,"Betty, I know where it all went wrong"
31107,Your favorite song was playing
31108,From the far side of the gym
31109,I was nowhere to be found
31110,"I hate the crowds, you know that"
31111,"Plus, I saw you dance with him"
31112,You heard the rumors from Inez
31113,You can't believe a word she says
31114,"Most times, but this time it was true"
31115,The worst thing that I ever did
31116,Was what I did to you
31117,But if I just showed up at your party

31119,Would you tell me to go fuck myself
31120,Or lead me to the garden?
31121,"In the garden, would you trust me"
31122,If I told you it was just a summer thing?
31123,"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
31124,But I know I miss you
31125,I was walking home on broken cobblestones
31126,Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
31127,A figment of my worst intentions
31128,"She said ""James, get in, let's drive"""
31129,Those days turned into nights
31130,"Slept next to her, but"
31131,I dreamt of you all summer long
31132,"Betty, I'm here on your doorstep"
31133,And I planned it out for weeks now
31134,But it's finally sinkin' in
31135,"Betty, right now is the last time"
31136,I can dream about what happens when
31137,You see my face again
31138,The only thing I wanna do
31139,Is make it up to you
31140,So I showed up at your party
31141,"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
31142,"Yeah, I showed up at your party"
31143,Will you have me? Will you love me?
31144,Will you kiss me on the porch
31145,In front of all your stupid friends?
31146,"If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?"
31147,Will it patch your broken wings?
31148,"I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything"
31149,But I know I miss you
31150,Standing in your cardigan
31151,Kissin' in my car again
31152,Stopped at a streetlight
31153,You know I miss you
31154,Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
31155,Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
31156,"But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom"
31157,"Holdin' him for ransom, some"
31158,"Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though"
31159,"Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so"
31160,"I see nothing better, I keep him forever"
31161,Like a vendetta-ta
31162,"I, I, I see how this is gon' go"
31163,Touch me and you'll never be alone
31164,I-Island breeze and lights down low

31169,"I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time"
31170,Are you ready for it?
31171,Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
31172,Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
31173,"But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and"
31174,"We'll move to an island, and"
31175,"And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor"
31176,Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
31177,"I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now"
31178,"Never be the same now, now"
31179,"I, I, I see how this is gon' go"
31180,Touch me and you'll never be alone

31444,So you gotta go easy on me
31445,I heard love is dangerous
31446,Once you fall you never get enough
31447,But the thought of you leaving
31448,Ain't so easy for me
31449,Don't hurt me
31450,Desert me
31451,Don't give up on me
31452,What would I wanna do that for?
31453,Don't use me
31454,Take advantage of me
31455,Make me sorry I ever counted on you
31456,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31457,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31458,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31459,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31460,Understand I've been here before
31461,Thought I found someone I finally could adore
31462,But you failed my test
31463,Got to know her better
31464,Saw I wasn't the only one
31465,"But, I'm willing to put my trust in you"
31466,Baby you can put your trust in me
31467,Just like you count to 3
31468,You can count on me
31469,And you're never gonna see
31470,No numbers in my pocket
31471,"Anything I'm doing, girl"
31472,I'll drop it for you
31473,Cause you're the one I'm giving my heart to but I gotta be the only one
31474,Don't hurt me
31475,Desert me
31476,Don't give up on me
31477,What would I wanna do that for?
31478,Don't use me
31479,Take advantage of me
31480,Make me sorry I ever counted on you
31481,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31482,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31483,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31484,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31485,I really hope you understand
31486,That if you wanna take my hand
31487,You should put yours over my heart
31488,I promise to be careful from the start
31489,I'm trusting you with loving me
31490,Never been so vulnerable
31491,Baby I'll make you comfortable
31492,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5 , baby, I'm counting on you"
31493,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5"
31494,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5, baby, I'm counting on you"
31495,"1, 2, 3, 4 to the 5"
31496,Now I'm about to give you my heart
31497,So remember this one thing
31498,I've never been in love before
31499,"Yeah, you gotta go easy on me"
31500,"If we never flew, we would never fall"
31501,"If the world was ours, we would have it all"
31502,"But the life we live, isn't so simplistic"
31503,You just don't get what you want
31504,So we take what comes and we keep on going
31505,Leaning on each other's shoulders
31506,Then we turn around
31507,And see we've come so far somehow
31508,"We're halfway there, we're looking good now"
31509,Nothing's gonna get in the way
31510,We're halfway there and looking back now
31511,I never thought that I'd ever say
31512,We're halfway there!
31513,We're halfway there!
31514,When the chips are down back against the wall
31515,Got no more to give 'cause we gave it all
31516,Seems like going the distance is unrealistic
31517,But we're too far from the start
31518,So we take what comes and we keep on going
31519,Leaning on each other's shoulders
31520,Then we turn around
31521,And see we've come so far somehow
31522,"We're halfway there, we're looking good now"
31523,Nothing's gonna get in the way
31524,We're halfway there and looking back now
31525,I never thought that I'd ever say
31526,We're halfway there!
31527,We're halfway there!
31528,How you ever gonna reach the stars
31529,If you never get off the ground?
31530,And you'll always be where you are
31531,If you let life knock you down
31532,"We're halfway there, we're looking good now"
31533,Nothing's gonna get in the way
31534,We're halfway there and looking back now
31535,I never thought that I'd ever say
31536,We're halfway there!
31537,We're halfway there!
31538,"Hah, yeah"
31539,"B.T.R., huh, huh"
31540,"Here I am there you are, why does it seem so far?"
31541,Next to you is where I should be
31542,"Something I want so bad, know what's inside your head"
31543,Maybe I could see what you see
31544,I gotta keep on believing that everything takes time
31545,I'll make up any reason to make you mine
31546,"If you're staying or leaving, I'll follow your lead"
31547,So why keep pretending? Open your eyes
31548,I can be what you need
31549,"Any kind of guy you want, girl"

31558,"You decide, It's alright, I will be there"
31559,"You seem so hard to know, say goodbye, say hello"
31560,Then you say that it's time to go
31561,"Changing my point of view, everyday something new"
31562,"Anything to get next to you , oh-oh"
31563,Gotta keep on believing that everything takes time
31564,I'll make up any reason to make you mine

32894,Nothin' but your heels on
32895,Losin' our religion
32896,You're my pretty little vixen
32897,And I'm the voice inside your head
32898,That keeps telling you to listen to all the bad things I say
32899,And you said
32900,I want you forever
32901,Even when we're not together
32902,Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
32903,I want you forever
32904,Even when we're not together
32905,Scars on my body I can look at you whenever
32906,Am I out of my head?
32907,Am I out of my mind?
32908,If you only knew the bad things I like
32909,Don't think that I can explain it
32910,"What can I say, it's complicated"
32911,Don't matter what you say
32912,Don't matter what you do
32913,I only wanna do bad things to you
32914,"So good, that you can't explain it"
32915,"What can I say, it's complicated"
32916,"The way we love, is so unique"
32917,"And when we touch, I'm shivering"
32918,And no one has to get it
32919,Just you and me
32920,Cause we're just living
32921,Between the sheets
32922,I want you forever
32923,Even when we're not together
32924,Scars on my body so I can take you wherever
32925,I want you forever

32935,I only wanna do bad things to you
32936,"So good, that you can't explain it"
32937,"What can I say, it's complicated"
32938,Somethin' must've gone wrong in my brain
32939,Got your chemicals all in my veins
32940,"Feelin' all the highs, feelin' all the pain"
32941,"Let go of the wheel, that's the bullet lane"
32942,"Now I'm seein' red, not thinkin' straight"
32943,"Blurrin' all the lines, you intoxicate me"
32944,"Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine"

33315,And I lost so much more than my senses
33316,'Cause loving you had consequences
33317,"Yeah, loving you"
33318,Spent 24 hours
33319,I need more hours with you

33764,With every breath you breathe
33765,I see there's something going on
33766,I don't understand why you're so cold
33767,Are we taking time or a time out?

33769,Asking me for space here in my house
33770,You know how to fuck with me
33771,Acting like we're not together
33772,After everything that we've been through
33773,Sleeping up under the covers

33791,Acting like we're not together
33792,"If you don't want this, then what's the use?"
33793,Sleeping up under the covers
33794,How am I so far away from you?
33795,"Distant , when we're kissing"

34155,"And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore"
34156,I tried my best to feed her appetite
34157,Keep her coming every night
34158,So hard to keep her satisfied
34159,Keep playing love like it was just a game
34160,Pretending to feel the same
34161,Then turn around and leave again
34162,This love has taken its toll on me
34163,She said goodbye too many times before
34164,And her heart is breaking in front of me
34165,"And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore"

34187,"Steal some covers, share some skin"
34188,Clouds are shrouding us in moments unforgettable

34190,"But things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do"
34191,"And I would gladly hit the road, get up and go if I knew"
34192,"That someday, it would lead me back to you"
34193,"That someday, it would lead me back to you"
34194,That may be all I need

34196,Come and rest your bones with me
34197,Driving slow on Sunday morning
34198,And I never want to leave
34199,Fingers trace your every outline
34200,Paint a picture with my hands
34201,"Back and forth, we sway like branches in a storm"
34202,"Change the weather, still together when it ends"
34203,That may be all I need
34204,"In darkness, she is all I see"
34205,Come and rest your bones with me
34206,Driving slow on Sunday morning
34207,And I never want to leave
34208,"Oh yeah, but things just get so crazy, living life gets hard to do"
34209,"Sunday morning, rain is falling and I'm calling out to you"
34210,"Singing, someday it'll bring me back to you"

34671,All my secrets away
34672,All my secrets away
34673,Can't I just turn back the clock?
34674,Forgive my sins
34675,I just wanna roll my sleeves up
34676,And start again
34677,I know that I messed it up
34678,Time and time again
34679,I just wanna roll my sleeves up
34680,And start again
34681,I was switchin' up the lanes
34682,Steppin' out the frame I'm in
34683,I was pulling on the reins
34684,Sick of all the same happenin'
34685,I swear I was looking for disaster
34686,Mixed with a bottle of gin
34687,And just because I come home after
34688,Doesn't mean you'll take me in
34689,You see my world is spinning like there's nothing below
34690,You see my world is feeling like it just might explode
34691,And yes I know it's hard to take it backwards from my mind
34692,"I need to get it right, need to see some light come in"
34693,Can't I just turn back the clock?
34694,Forgive my sins
34695,I just wanna roll my sleeves up
34696,And start again
34697,I know that I messed it up
34698,Time and time again
34699,I just wanna roll my sleeves up
34700,And start again
34701,Feelin' like maybe I'm unappreciated
34702,Like my presence in your life has been alleviated
34703,I feel like everything I've done before is different now
34704,But I can see clearer than ever from a distance now
34705,"Every day I do it, I been goin' through it"
34706,But you never knew it 'cause I never showed you
34707,"You gave me the world, so I feel I owed you"
34708,I been lookin' through the mirror and that's the old you
34709,"I'ma get it right now, don't know how"
34710,But I promise that we're gonna make it somehow
34711,"I'm all in, it's from the heart again"
34712,Open up your mind and maybe we could start again
34713,Can't I just turn back the clock?
34714,Forgive my sins
34715,I just wanna roll my sleeves up
34716,And start again
34717,I know that I messed it up
34718,Time and time again

34726,Forgive my sins
34727,I just wanna roll my sleeves up
34728,And start again
34729,"I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground"
34730,"And I'm hearing what you say, but I just can't make a sound"
34731,"You tell me that you need me, then you go and cut me down"
34732,But wait
34733,"You tell me that you're sorry, didn't think I'd turn around"
34734,And say
34735,"It's too late to apologize, it's too late"
34736,"I said it's too late to apologize, it's too late"
34737,"Too late, oh, oh"
34738,"I'd take another chance, take a fall, take a shot for you, oh, oh"
34739,"I need you like a heart needs a beat, but it's nothing new"
34740,"Yeah, yeah"
34741,"I loved you with a fire red, now it's turning blue"
34742,And you say
34743,Sorry like the angel Heaven let me think was you
34744,But I'm afraid
34745,"It's too late to apologize, it's too late"
34746,I said it's too late to apologize
34747,"It's too late, oh, oh"
34748,"It's too late to apologize, it's too late"

34752,"I'm holding on your rope, got me ten feet off the ground"
34753,"When, when we came home"
34754,Worn to the bones
34755,"I told myself, ""this could get rough"""
34756,"And when, when I was off, which happened a lot"
34757,"You came to me and said, ""that's enough"""
34758,"Oh, I know that this love is pain"
34759,"But we can't cut it from out these veins, no"
34760,So I'll hit the lights and you lock the doors
34761,We ain't leaving this room 'til we both feel more
34762,"Don't walk away, don't roll your eyes"

34780,"If this love is pain, then honey let's love tonight"
34781,I remember talking and drinking what we could find
34782,Burnin' all those candles and stayin' up through the night
34783,We'd make reservations for the places we know we'd never try
34784,"But then oh, we found some rich love"
34785,I remember feeling broke as a bottle of wine
34786,I didn't move to the city to count all my pennies
34787,And worship the Hollywood sign
34788,"She'll say, ""Hey man, nice to meet you,"""
34789,And she'll take every one last time
34790,"And I know, 'cause I found some fake love"

34805,"'Cause oh, we had some new love"
34806,"Ooh, broke as a bottle of wine"

34885,"Kids from Oklahoma, man, we don't waste it"
34886,I'm just tryna paint the picture for me
34887,Something I could give a damn about in maybe 40
34888,Years and I be ready and willing and able to edit the story

34916,When I need your love? If I need your help?
34917,"Would you rescue me? Ah, would you rescue me?"
34918,"We don't talk much, not anymore"
34919,Broken bottles and slammin' doors
34920,But we still care about each other
34921,Say we care about each other
34922,I know life took us far away
34923,But I still dream 'bout the good old days
34924,When we took care of each other
34925,We were livin' for each other
34926,"But I start to wonder, wonder"
34927,"If I'm slipping under, under"

34941,"Yeah, I miss all the times we had"
34942,Can't forget what you can't get back
34943,And you can't find it in another
34944,"Man, time, it ain't your lover"
34945,I don't care what you thought before
34946,I'll be there anytime you call
34947,Don't you ever call another
34948,No need to call another

34975,I'm the one at the sail
34976,"I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh"
34977,"The master of my sea, oh-ooh"
34978,I was broken from a young age
34979,Taking my sulkin' to the masses
34980,Writing my poems for the few
34981,"That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me"
34982,Singing from heartache from the pain
34983,Taking my message from the veins
34984,Speaking my lesson from the brain
34985,Seeing the beauty through the...
34986,"Pain! You made me a, you made me a"
34987,"Believer, believer"
34988,Pain! You break me down and build me up
34989,"Believer, believer"

34992,"Pain! You made me a, you made me a"
34993,"Believer, believer"
34994,Third things third

34996,All the hate that you've heard
34997,"Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh"
34998,"Your spirit up above, oh-ooh"
34999,I was chokin' in the crowd
35000,Building my rain up in the cloud
35001,Falling like ashes to the ground
35002,"Hoping my feelings, they would drown"
35003,"But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'"
35004,"Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down"
35005,"It rained down, like…"

35016,You're the face of the future
35017,"The blood in my veins, oh-ooh"
35018,"The blood in my veins, oh-ooh"
35019,"But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'"
35020,"Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down"

35029,"Believer, believer"
35030,Just a young gun with a quick fuse
35031,"I was uptight, wanna let loose"
35032,I was dreaming of bigger things
35033,And wanna leave my own life behind
35034,"Not a ""Yes, sir,"" not a follower"
35035,"Fit the box, fit the mold"
35036,"Have a seat in the foyer, take a number"

35051,Dreaming 'bout being a big star
35052,"They say, ""You're basic,"" they say, ""You're easy"""
35053,You're always riding in the backseat
35054,Now I'm smiling from the stage

36736,"Ohh, don't double charge me for that"
36737,Don't do it to yourself
36738,'Cause I might just ask what the ice cube's worth
36739,What the ice cube's worth
36740,That's the only differentiator making this a non-free perk
36741,And I might make work more difficult for you than it need be
36742,"So think about it, take a minute, let it breathe, B"
36743,"But think about it, bruh, you saw me get the burger with the bacon on the side"
36744,After looking at the price of the side of just bacon
36745,And comparing it to the what the difference in the cheeseburger
36746,Versus the bacon cheeseburger was and making my decision
36747,I would hate to be the waiter tryna tell me something different
36748,I'ma get on Yelp in a minute and review
36749,This piece of shit place like only a kike know how
36750,Unless you take the extra coffee off I might get loud unless you...
36751,"Oh, it was just an accident?"
36752,You didn't even mean that
36753,You didn't even... that was... that's... I'm so embarrassed
36754,"Hello, how can I help you?"
36755,"Hi, my name’s Dave Burd. Uh, I have an appointment today"
36756,"It’s probably under ""Lil Dicky"", actually. I’m a… I’m a rapper, so…"
36757,"Okay, and who are you here to see?"
36758,"Uh, Snoop Dogg? Says here ""Snoop D-O-G-G"""
36759,"Oh, yeah. He’s right down the hall. First door to your right"
36760,Give him a knock and he should be right with you
36761,"Thanks. It’s uh, this door right here, right?"
36762,Mm-hmm
36763,Thank you
36764,Grab a seat
36765,"Thanks, I’m Dave, very nice to meet"
36766,"Dave, what it do? You can call me Dogg"
36767,Let me just check your sheet
36768,"No problem, sir, let me just say"
36769,I’m a big fan of the shit the gen' make
36770,"I can’t lie, I been thinking about this all day"
36771,"All good, there’s a reason that we called, Dave, let me start with your background, where you come from?"
36772,"Sure, I was undergrad down there in Richmond"
36773,Before that
36774,"Oh, you talking 'bout my hometown?"
36775,Yeah
36776,I was born out of Philly grew up in a little silly old town called Cheltenham
36777,"It was in the suburbs, upper-middle wealth around"
36778,So real shit you ain’t never had to struggle for much
36779,"I wouldn’t say it like that, we just had a different kind of trap"
36780,Elaborate
36781,"Well I ain’t never had a tool, but I had to be the man at school"
36782,"Like I was doing shit I had to do so when I finished undergrad, I’m cool and I can get whatever job I wanted"
36783,But the job you wanted wasn’t all that bumping
36784,"Yeah, and I saw it quick all the flaws that be coming when you grow up like that"
36785,"When you been racing them rats, you ain’t been making them raps"
36786,Boo-hoo what a hardship
36787,How you paid to get the rap shit started?
36788,"Man, my Bar Mitzvah money"
36789,"But don’t diss me buddy, I wasn’t one of them youngins up on the block who had nothing to lose"
36790,"I must’ve wanted this a lot, I had something to choose"
36791,"Ha, look at that, I can say there’s something to prove up in your ass"
36792,"Yeah, I guess"
36793,"That’s enough of the past, what makes you want to do rap?"
36794,"Oh my God, it’s the best"
36795,Bitches let me draw up on their breasts
36796,"Literally, I can reinvent myself, I get a forum to project myself"
36797,"It’s never boring, every morning I wake up and try to best myself"
36798,I never got to be suppressed or stealthy to express myself
36799,It’s kinda healthy
36800,"Cool, now let me put you through a couple hypotheticals"
36801,Sure
36802,In a club and a couple niggas threaten you
36803,"Uh, I wouldn’t do shit"
36804,And I don’t even get what that got to do with this?
36805,"Shut the fuck up, rap's like life"
36806,"If you wanna do this, then you won’t get far acting like a little bitch"
36807,"Nah, that’s my niche!"
36808,"Don’t get offended by this, but that’s the market y’all missed"
36809,That’s the target I’ll hit
36810,And that’s the heart of my pitch
36811,I wanna do this whole thing different
36812,What the fuck you mean you wanna do the whole thing different?
36813,"Uh, you know, I-I think, like, you know"
36814,"Traditionally people have been doing the job, uh, you know, the same kind of way for a long time"
36815,"But traditionally speaking, this shit works, right?"
36816,"Nah, like, I get that, but I-I just think like, you know"
36817,You don’t know if it could be working even better
36818,And I think you should look at me as an opportunity to find that out
36819,I don’t mean any disrespect by that
36820,I’m just saying I have a different background
36821,Like a different perspective way of looking at things than your typical applicant
36822,So what are your biggest strengths?
36823,"Well my flow is crazy, I can switch that amazing"
36824,"For example, I can be like ain’t nobody fucking with Lil Dicky"
36825,When he get up on that shit and spit it sick and ridiculous
36826,Ripping this shit like it’s never been did and the rhythm is never predictable
36827,"'Cause I can switch it, deliver this shit in whatever cadence you bitches prefer"
36828,"All right, all right, I get it"
36829,"Top of that, lyrically I’m pretty damn clever"
36830,"Got a long bottom bitch, call the ho Neville"
36831,"And I blew it from the jump, Derrick Rose knee"
36832,You can say I’m pretty smart how I know better
36833,"And y’all been winning like Pistorius, it’s no feat"
36834,"Bro, I can go on and on"
36835,I’m taking over any man like father-in-laws
36836,"Okay enough of the punchline, that ain’t showing me you different than the other guys"
36837,Well I don’t know if they can run it like that
36838,But ain’t nobody else doing funny type rap
36839,What’s that?
36840,Well I can tell a story about my morning
36841,Watching Boy Meets World and jerking off to Topanga Lawrence
36842,Like the 14 year old Topanga
36843,Oh this shit like a joke to you? I don’t get it
36844,Nah it ain’t like that I just happen to be a nutty abundantly funny type of individual
36845,"Like, as a guy, so when I get up on the mic I ain’t finna just lie"
36846,"Real recognize real, right?"
36847,"Yeah, I guess... so what you tryna do"
36848,"Five years from now, tell me 'bout the dude"
36849,"Well, I don’t care about the money"
36850,"Like, it’s the respect that I’m wanting"
36851,"Honestly, I just want to be one of the greats"
36852,Where they gotta bring your boy up every debate
36853,I don’t wanna leave the game the same
36854,"In a nutshell, what’s your legacy?"
36855,"Well, I wanna be the dude that came in and made the stand-up rap"
36856,Put the random rap in demand like that for the people that was anti-rap
36857,"Yet, the fans of rap start to recognize that anti-rap"
36858,Is ironically one of the real brands of rap left
36859,That shit sound pretty damn complex
36860,"I guess, I wanna be the best"
36861,I just wanna do it my way
36862,And turn the whole game sideways
36863,And show people you ain’t gotta be resigned to the highway
36864,You can make a path while these motherfuckers drive straight
36865,I ain’t mad at that
36866,"Well thanks, man, that’s my plan of my attack"
36867,Just let me in and I’ma rap the plaques
36868,And I ain’t about to win them back to back
36869,I’m 'bout to win them like it’s back to back to back to back to back
36870,'Til I stop rapping
36871,"You ain’t even sold a damn album yet, true"
36872,That’s a lot of talk from a wily vet
36873,Let alone a young rook nigga
36874,You misread me
36875,Nah this ain’t a book nigga
36876,"Well that’s one of my flaws, I’m too competitive dawg"
36877,"No, you just fucking repetitive dawg"
36878,"I get it, you trying to be better than all, but you ain’t shit until cheddar's involved"
36879,I get that I gotta prove myself
36880,No shit you ain’t done shit
36881,Think about that though
36882,Only doing this a couple of years
36883,One tape and I’m like this?
36884,This shit is aight for your first shit
36885,But you don’t know if it’s your worst shit
36886,You don’t think finding out would be worth it?
36887,"It might be, it might not"
36888,"But I’ma put your ass to work, kid"
36889,"Wait, like, like I have the job? Like really?"
36890,"Well one more thing, let me see if you could put a hook together"
36891,What would you do for the hook for this song?
36892,"Uh, you want me to make a hook up right now?"
36893,Do I look like the type of nigga that like repeating himself?
36894,"All right, uh, okay"
36895,Man do the hook!
36896,I’m 'bout to be professional
36897,"Homie, I’m professional"
36898,"Uh, maybe like a low voice type thing?"
36899,"Nigga, that shit is garbage man"
36900,"Well, you know, I feel like there might have been some upside to it"
36901,But I’m not good at thinking of things on the spot like that
36902,Don’t y’all normally like outsource for that kind of thing sometimes?
36903,"Sometimes, but you know, that was some next level Dogg shit right there"
36904,"Yeah, you know, I’m just way better when I get to think things through"
36905,Have my like that dual screen action that type of thing
36906,"Whatever man, you tryna smoke a blunt?"
36907,Right now?
36908,Yeah
36909,Sure
36910,"Dope. Juanita, bring some weed in here, please. Thank you"
36911,"You got it, Snoop. I’ll be right there"
36912,"Thanks, Juanita. Super nice woman"
36913,"Nigga, why does everything you say sound so soft?"
36914,"Uh, I really don’t wanna be spoken to like that, so…"
36915,"Pfft, yeah, whatever. Thanks"
36916,"Hey, I got y’all your weed"
36917,"Damn, that’s some great looking weed. It’s just so early"
36918,Can I get you guys anything else while I’m here? Coffee? Tea? Head? Bottled water?
36919,D-Did you just say head?
36920,Yeah. You ain’t never got no head before?
36921,"I mean… Just feels like… A lot, right now"
36922,Okay
36923,But what kind of tea do you guys have?
36924,"We got mint, raspberry, Earl Grey, English Breakfast..."
36925,"Actually, I’ll take head"
36926,I knew your little dirty ass wanted some head
36927,"Ayy, ayy, damn"
36928,"L tapped twice on some ass, like grams"
36929,"I just fucked, ay"

36947,"""It's just a personal thing, it's not you"""

36952,"""Only thing I know is that it's colder"""
36953,"""Break it down, how's it compare to livin' in LA?"""
36954,"""Well, I can't compare them, they're so different"""
36955,"""You know what I'm sayin'?"""
36956,"""Yeah, for sure"""
36957,"She like, ""Apples to oranges"""
36958,"""Well, you can still compare them, but I hear you"""
36959,"""Uh, what's the deal with your family? Got any siblings?"""
36960,"She like, ""I have a brother"""
36961,"I'm like, ""Oh, what he do?"""
36962,"She like, ""He in the Army"""
36963,"""Oh, true"""
36964,"""Uh, do you fuck with the war?"""
36965,"She like, ""Huh? What did you just say?"""
36966,"""Uh, like, just now?"", ""Yeah"""
36967,"""Do you fuck with the war?"""
36968,"""No, I don't fuck with the war"""
36969,"I'm like, ""No, I don't fuck with the war!"""

36972,"""Uh, why would you thank me?"""
36973,"""Uh, I guess I assumed it extended to families"""
36974,"But, okay, while we're on the topic, I been actually thinkin'"
36975,"About some shit, about the Army and Navy"
36976,What if tomorrow is the day that the fuckin' aliens came and invaded our nation?
36977,"Like, would we even be able to fuck with their shit?"
36978,"Like, do we got the type of weaponry to fuck with their ships?"
36979,"Or not at all, like, would they just walk up in this motherfucker"
36980,"Laughin' at us, and blastin' at us"
36981,And makin' everybody disintegrate and assimilate without a hint of intimidation?
36982,Or could we do some shit to be makin' they heart race?
36983,"Granted, I don't know the alien heart"
36984,"But, you get what the fuck I'm sayin'? ""Uhm"""
36985,Like what the fuck would it be like?
36986,"Would they be like ""Earth go hard"""

36988,"Or would they be like, ""Damn, Earth go hard"""
36989,They was harder than Simian
36990,"You ever talk to your brother about this, uh, type of stuff?"
36991,"Then she like, ""No"""

36996,"""In the war?"", ""In aliens"""
36997,"""Oh, hold up, hold up, wait"""
36998,"""Girl, what you sayin'?"""
36999,"""That all of the life in the universe happens to be where you stand?"""
37000,"""I– I guess"""
37001,"""What an enormous coincidence that shit would be"""
37002,"""Do you see what I'm sayin'?"""
37003,"""I can't hear what you're sayin'"""
37004,"""Well, the universe always expandin'"""
37005,"""There are infinite galaxies"""
37006,"""Why would we be the anomaly?"""
37007,"She like ""That's no coincidence"",  ""I call that shit God"""
37008,"I'm like ""Oh, you're religious, bitch"""
37009,"""You think it's all God?"""
37010,"""No, I know it's all God"""
37011,"""No, I know that there might be a God"""
37012,"""First off, nobody knows there's a God"""
37013,"""Girl, I think we should drop this"""
37014,"""No, what's goin' on in your brain right now?"""
37015,"Brain, ayy, Brain on some other shit though"
37016,"I been all up in the club for a year, hey"
37017,"I been killin' shit, don't mind me, eh"
37018,"Uh, I'm just top flight, ah"
37019,"Uh, I could sure use a Sprite"
37020,I'm thirsty as fuck
37021,Who gettin' money? That's Brain
37022,Who make decisions? That's Brain
37023,Who make the hits? That been Brain
37024,Who run this whole operation? That been Brain since—
37025,"Brain, can— can you just get back to the issue here?"
37026,"Uh, really? Can you just remind the Brain?"
37027,"You're such an idiot, we're talking about God and if He exists"
37028,"Don't call Brain names, uh"
37029,The Brain couldn't recall
37030,"But if I'm not mistaken, this bitch to my left"
37031,Guaranteed there's a God
37032,"I believe in a God, yes"
37033,"So, God never wrong?"
37034,"God never wrong, right?"
37035,"Heh, yeah, that's, like, the whole point"
37036,"Brain, just get there, please"
37037,"Hold up, so, God made the Earth"
37038,"And God was like, hold up"
37039,This shit is borin'
37040,It need more shit
37041,"God was like, ""I'ma put dinosaurs on that bitch"""
37042,"""Dinosaurs on that bitch"""
37043,"Then He like, ""Why'd I put dinosaurs on that shit?"""
37044,What is your brain even saying?
37045,Can he get to the point?
37046,"Hold up, Brain, you just did it! Ah"
37047,"God ain't wrong, what the fuck was He thinking?"
37048,"About what? Bitch, the dinosaurs!"
37049,"He made the Earth for them, but then He like, 'Nah'?"
37050,'Dinosaurs are just blah'? What's your point?
37051,'I'ma cook up some blondes'?
37052,"Like, He was way off, I don't look like a dinosaur"
37053,"Ho, them things thirty-five feet"
37054,I'm like five-foot-eleven
37055,Seen that Bronchiosaurus?
37056,That thing fuckin' neck go to heaven
37057,"And that's just an expression, bitch"
37058,There ain't no heaven
37059,"Funny – I'm just messin', but if he ain't wrong"
37060,I guess this the exception
37061,Can I talk now? Go ahead
37062,"Look, everything in life has purpose"
37063,"You, chickens, a midget at a circus"
37064,What? I don't interpret
37065,"She like, ”That's not for me to determine”"
37066,So dinosaurs' purpose was to just die?
37067,That's not for me to determine
37068,"But, okay – I'm just a person"
37069,"Okay, but think of the root of the argument, girl"
37070,"View how we started this, girl"
37071,"Like, you don't believe in the aliens"
37072,"Yeah, I just—"
37073,"You confine God to Earth, girl, I find that shit salient"
37074,I just don't presume to know the plan
37075,"Bitch, me neither, but that's not what I've been sayin'"
37076,"Well, what are you saying?"
37077,Why can't God fuck with aliens?
37078,Why can't Earth be like a fuckin' small side project for this guy?
37079,"Okay, look, we just don't see eye to eye"
37080,"Yeah, but logically, like, you don't believe in your side"
37081,"Well, you're bringin' up fuckin' dinosaurs"
37082,"Like, we could have shared the Earth with them, nobody knows"
37083,"Yeah, there is hard soil evidence, girl"
37084,"Like what's next, you don't fuck with Pangaea?"
37085,"She like, ""Let’s change the subject"""
37086,"Okay, this bitch don't know 'bout Pangaea"
37087,"Brain, leave it alone"
37088,"Uh, I'm starvin' – are you hungry, by chance?"
37089,"Oh, my God, I'm so hungry"
37090,"Yes, do you wanna get a pizza?"
37091,"Fuck yeah, Fuck yeah, I'm on it"
37092,"Also, I'm sorry about that whole interrogation thing"
37093,"Come on, dude, I'm a grown up"
37094,I'm capable of having intelligent conversations
37095,"Okay, I just— fuck it"
37096,"Back to this pizza, I lean pepperoni"
37097,Ugh – sausage?
37098,How can you eat that shit?
37099,"No, no, no, this not Domino's, this legit"
37100,It's high quality meat and shit
37101,"No, no, I'm vegetarian"
37102,"Oh, right, well, we can get half pepperoni"
37103,And half of whatever you like
37104,"Ugh, ew, I can't have that shit in the same box"
37105,"Uh, s— seriously? – Yeah"
37106,You're that against meat?
37107,"No, I'm that against us being gluttonous"
37108,Thinkin' that animals live on this earth to get eat
37109,"Okay, is it how we treat them?"
37110,"Heh, that sure doesn't help"
37111,"Okay – she like, ”I'm not opposed to us huntin'"""
37112,"""But now we not trackin' them down"""
37113,"""We just breed 'em to eat, that's disgustin'"""
37114,"""You should honestly read on the subject"""
37115,"All right, hold up"
37116,Just because we're not runnin' around with a bow and arrow
37117,Doesn't mean we're not huntin' these chickens
37118,We just set the place to do our huntin' intelligently enough
37119,To manipulate these animals and get them to do exactly what we want
37120,"That's my point, we just incubate animals"
37121,Instead of just letting them live how they come
37122,"Yeah, but, that's your God at work, bitch!"
37123,While we go hard on Earth
37124,What you think would happen right now if you left my place
37125,And there were like three wolves waitin' for you?
37126,"Wolves? – Bitch, they would tear your ass up!"
37127,"Viciously, like, they would eat your titties"
37128,That's what they do
37129,"Humans are smarter, bitch, that's what we do"
37130,"She like, ”Apples to oranges”"
37131,"Bitch, that phrase don't make no sense"
37132,Why can't fruit be compared?
37133,"She like, ”I'm gonna leave”"
37134,There's just all of these conflicting principles
37135,"Right, enjoy your pepperoni pizza"
37136,"I will, that's my God-given right"
37137,"She like, ”Where is my bag?”"
37138,"Oh, that leather one next to the trash?"
37139,"That's the one, right? Made out of cow, I think?"
37140,"Ugh, why are there no Ubers in this area?"
37141,"So you don't eat the meat , you just be wearin' that shit"
37142,"I'm not listenin', dude – that's barbaric as shit"
37143,Do you come from the vikings?
37144,Why are you even still talking?
37145,"Do you take peoples' land? I'm not listenin', dude"
37146,Do you fuck with the war?
37147,How are there no Ubers anywhere?
37148,"Just download Lyft , they are bigger in presence out here"
37149,I don't wanna add shit to my phone
37150,"Okay, the choices are clear, ho"
37151,"Ubers are not around here, ho"
37152,"Taxis will come, but they real slow"
37153,"Ayy, the Brain gotta poop"
37154,T minus five 'til the Brain gotta shit
37155,"I just downloaded Lyft, but it's being so glitchy"
37156,"Uh, look, do you just want to sleep here?"
37157,"Uh, no thanks – It's past 2 AM"
37158,I'm not sharing a bed with you
37159,"You can sleep in my bed, I'll sleep on the floor"
37160,"Fine, you're sure? Yeah, it's cool"
37161,I won't throw you out to the wolves
37162,"Oh, my God, you are so annoying"
37163,"I couldn't help myself, but can you at least throw me a pillow?"
37164,"I'm just pillow talkin' with a bitch, ayy"
37165,"I'm just pillow talkin' with a bitch, ayy"
37166,"I just finished spazzin' on a bitch, ayy"
37167,Now I'm pillow talkin' with a bitch
37168,"Brain gotta poop, still"
37169,Please don't neglect the Brain
37170,Please don't neglect the Brain
37171,"Hold on, is that my Lyft? I don't know if I—"
37172,"Nah, I got a pizza – full pepperoni, too"
37173,"So, you're not gonna wanna be a part of it"
37174,But first you should poop
37175,Please don't neglect the Brain
37176,"Yeah... man, this is the softest thing I ever did"
37177,But... it's about something that's pretty important to me
37178,And that's you
37179,And that's true
37180,Really wish that I didn't care about you anymore
37181,But I do
37182,What do I do when the rap life
37183,Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
37184,Make a young couple do something sad like
37185,Being broke up even though we had life
37186,"Fuck it, I don't even know what I could've done"
37187,"Looking back thinking, ""That's what I should've done"""
37188,Wanting you back
37189,But when the fact is I always put you second to rap
37190,I'm not mad that you wouldn't come
37191,"And even though I had to move, I ain't move on"
37192,Really wish you was a boo I could prove wrong
37193,But she knows what I'ma do with the new songs
37194,"And she know I'm pretty soon with your dude on, running the rap game"
37195,With that lane always gotta be up on that train
37196,"Or that plane, ain't nobody want to feel that pain"
37197,With that strain wishin' I ain't gotta get that fame
37198,"Or acclaim, you know I'd give you my last name"
37199,"Put that blame on me, chasin' something, feelin' dumb cause you all I need"
37200,Hope you wait until I'm done and I'm all free
37201,But you know I never know when that's gon' be
37202,And I'm sorry
37203,It's the hardest rule to follow
37204,I really wish that I could call you
37205,You can find another me tomorrow
37206,"And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe"
37207,If I woke up and I called it quits
37208,If today I gave up all of this
37209,Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
37210,"And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby"
37211,And that's you
37212,And that's true
37213,Really wish that I didn't
37214,Care about you anymore
37215,But I do
37216,What do I do when the rap life
37217,Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
37218,Make a young couple do something sad like
37219,Being broke up even though we had life
37220,When I'm being dumb and stupid who the fuck is gonna hit me with the motherfuckin' jerk face?
37221,Who gon' let me know to hit my mother on her birthday?
37222,Who gon' let me know when I be shopping if a shirt's gay?
37223,And when I'm on the road I be missing that
37224,"Always looking at my phone, you would give me crap"
37225,Ever since I been alone I've been thinking back
37226,Listenin' to your autotune in my mic'phone making us laugh
37227,You know the past was a blast but it never could last
37228,Pretty sad when your love got a separate path
37229,Used to read when there's nothing to do
37230,"But it's funny, doing nothin's never nothin' when it's somethin' with you"
37231,"You know I want to still talk, even text and call"
37232,"Whenever something's going on I be pressin' ""Mol"" up in the phone"
37233,"'Til I press the ""x,"" stressed, the next one'll best the ex and you'll forget, but it's best"
37234,"You the best to me girl, always baked me something"
37235,"And when it ripped off, you replaced my buttons"
37236,But don't be pissed off if I hate your husband
37237,"'Cause even when I can't say ""love ya,"" I love ya"
37238,It's the hardest rule to follow
37239,I really wish that I could call you
37240,You can find another me tomorrow
37241,"And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe"
37242,If I woke up and I called it quits
37243,If today I gave up all of this
37244,Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
37245,"And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby"
37246,And that's you
37247,And that's true
37248,Really wish that I didn't
37249,Care about you anymore
37250,But I do
37251,What do I do when the rap life
37252,Make a motherfucker choose up in that fight?
37253,Make a young couple do something sad like
37254,Being broke up even though we had life
37255,It's the hardest rule to follow
37256,I really wish that I could call you
37257,You can find another me tomorrow
37258,"And that's the hardest pill to swallow, babe"
37259,If I woke up and I called it quits
37260,If today I gave up all of this
37261,Maybe I could get you back tomorrow
37262,"And that's the hardest pill to swallow, baby"
37263,"Ain’t no doubt about it, shit is coming"
37264,And I’m just praying that Lil Dicky love it
37265,Always told myself that this the type of shit I wanted
37266,"I was being honest, even made a promise"
37267,"Not with anybody else, this was inner conscious"
37268,"Talking to my fucking self, das' a little bonkers"
37269,"I know, I still got a lot of shit to conquer"
37270,I hope that ain't even my concern though
37271,You know I’ll be working till I get what I deserve
37272,Whatever totems I get personally you know I’ma earn those
37273,This ain't even 'bout some shit up on a checklist
37274,This about the fact that I’m about to test this
37275,I’m about to figure out what my best is
37276,I can't avoid it because now ya' boy invested
37277,And I ain't gotta a choice except to smile and accept it
37278,"Pretty reckless, pretty restless 'cause"
37279,I’ve lived my life expecting love
37280,"To come the second my attempt was done, and yeah, I guess"
37281,To some extent I was correct because I’m getting buzz
37282,"But now I’m 'bout to be ubiquitous, look it up"
37283,"Yeah, or that’s at least what I’m assuming"
37284,But as alluded to reality is looming and
37285,Now ya' dude about to make a move and take the truth
37286,And hope to God that when he through
37287,That what he thought about is proven
37288,"But honestly, I'm not afraid that it’s delusion"
37289,I’m hot enough to where I know it’s not illusion
37290,But obviously I been finding this confusing
37291,This ain’t even close to what I thought I would be doing
37292,"Don’t get me wrong, I was born to be big"
37293,But I always figured it would be the comedy thing
37294,So I started rapping just to see what drama it brings
37295,What big dogs from sitcoms would holler at me
37296,"And as the time past, I rhymed faster, lines crafted"
37297,"Was high class as I mastered my craft, and"
37298,"Goddamn, who’da thought it get like this"
37299,Back in twenty-ten music wouldn’t make that list
37300,"I’m talking top five-to-ten strengths, with no winks"
37301,"I would not lie, my pen dry, with no ink"
37302,"Or, that’s at least what I thought 'til I clawed and scratched the pen 'til I saw a line draw"
37303,Then I coulda let bygones be bygones
37304,But I really wanted to rhyme till my line drawn
37305,Like where the fuck is my peak at?
37306,"Not Brown but I make it pop, then I beat that"
37307,"Not crowned yet, but I don’t think I decreed that"
37308,"Not loud, but you know I’m ready to tweet that"
37309,I just really hope I’m ready to be that
37310,Now you seeing where D’s at
37311,'Cause even though I’m softer than a tissue
37312,I ain't nothing to sneeze at
37313,"I’m smarter, where fuck ya' degrees at"
37314,"And I ain't harder but I’m hotter homie, where da fuck ya degrees at"
37315,I’m 'bout to come in and desaturate
37316,The chic rap today and evaporate
37317,"The feedback I hate, I elaborate"
37318,At a later date
37319,But I’m getting off the point with the player hate
37320,"What the fuck was I saying, oh yeah"
37321,I’m kind of a slave
37322,"To my ambition, I ain't quittin' till my shit is appraised"
37323,"And I admit it, I predict that where I finish is crazy"
37324,But that just means that it’s further away
37325,"So, Burd about to work until he turn in his grave"
37326,It’s really burdensome when earning something’s fun for the day
37327,But I’m concerned about da' burning out from upping the stakes
37328,I’m always uppin' the stakes
37329,"I’m taking dinner meetings in New York, always up for the steaks"
37330,We exploring the discussion of great
37331,They assuring me that when I’m more elite I’ll be secure and amazed
37332,But this isn’t insecurity mang…
37333,"Like this the opposite of that, confidence in fact"
37334,My biggest problem is I can't honestly relax
37335,Because inside of me a damn odyssey enacts
37336,And I made a promise that I can't be the body
37337,"That’s stopping it, think I need a lobotomy"
37338,"Lil Dicky the prophecy, little bit of anomaly, not a commodity"
37339,"Not a façade, or a lotta da Comedy prodigies"
37340,Commonly brought up wit Dicky
37341,"Feelin' weird, lemme think of an analogy"
37342,Just imagine for a second what if Russell Westbrook never knew his own mentality
37343,Grew up on a farm where the biggest commonality
37344,Was people that conform to the ruralest localities
37345,To Russell though it was nuffin' but normality
37346,And he really nice up on the plow in actuality
37347,Everybody liked the kid and dug his personality
37348,And so da mutuality was somewhat rationality
37349,So then ya man made a plan of practicality
37350,"Not even a plan, it was more of a formality"
37351,Get a little land and attend to its vitality
37352,Then raise a little fam 'til it all became finality
37353,The strategy was just to stay in the course
37354,"And do ya chores, when ya' happy ya' ain't need to abort"
37355,Never explored nothing less he rollin' round on his horse
37356,Then one day he was up on his horse
37357,"That’s when he went past the porch, the path he normally"
37358,"Passes forth was fast and short, was after more"
37359,"Went faster north, amassed a lure to master more"
37360,And then discovered the court
37361,He like ya! Let me down Tim
37362,"Hopped off, lookin' puzzled at the round rim"
37363,Saw a ball up in the corner on the ground then
37364,Russell started dribbling and giggling astounded
37365,Then he shot a brick and then a brick and then he downed it
37366,And when he hit it Russell listened to the fuckin' sound friction
37367,Up in a swish make and he was confounded
37368,Because he knew that he had found him
37369,But right now; it was still for the fun
37370,Just a way to kill the time when the farming was done
37371,"Then the walking turned to running, and the hoppin' turned to jumping"
37372,"And dunking, and Russell had to keep coming"
37373,Because the young’n was fucking disgusting and loving it
37374,"Running it, all of a sudden the public started to come in abundance and fuck wit him"
37375,"'Cause he was butter and hungry, hung jury"
37376,"'Cause stories of glory, not normally for people like him"
37377,Then the word got around up to ESPN
37378,And they flying Russell down to compete in the gym
37379,Bunch a grown men lookin' to belittle the kid
37380,"Because to those men, ball was the reason to live"
37381,And the G.O.A.T.S. they been all in since they was kids
37382,So this goat owning mafucka look like a dick
37383,"And even know Russell knows that, he doesn’t submit"
37384,He just chills with a grin
37385,"And then the game start, and this muthafucka take charge"
37386,"Make it rain, hard D up on these bitches making children of men"
37387,Lookin' better than his predecessors ever could get
37388,Turned the animosity to respect
37389,And then the Thunder called him
37390,Said they heard a lot about the ballin'
37391,Told him that they wanna get involved and
37392,"Showed him all the shit that you can get up in the league, it’s so appalling"
37393,"Oklahoma City in the autumn, hella pretty"
37394,"Awesome, errbody laud him"
37395,Erry-bitty lookin' like they really fucking fallin'
37396,Condominium is so legitimate it’s sprawling
37397,And this muthafucka on the court straight ballin'
37398,"Cash all up in that ass, lol’ing at the past like"
37399,"Where the fuck would I be at up on the other path, right?"
37400,If I never stumbled 'pon the game then think of that life
37401,"Shit, who taking care of my farm?"
37402,Who taking care of my farm?
37403,Who taking care of my farm?
37404,"I really loved that farm, uh"
37405,"CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE, CAKE"
37406,Five-hundred million now that’s a pound cake
37407,"According to Jay Z, and Drake…"
37408,But greatness ain’t about cake
37409,"Drunk, faded"
37410,"Browned out, looking all shady"
37411,Two months since I fucked a lady
37412,Young Man dick going crazy
37413,Standard Saturday
37414,I'm about to get a cab and masturbate
37415,Then I see a hot girl look back at Dave
37416,"Lemme get your cat girl, no Hathaway"
37417,That's what I thought not what I said to her
37418,"'Stead I walk up to her like, ""I know you heard of the kid"
37419,"You heard what I did, you heard of my shit, the murderous spit"""
37420,"She's like, ""Naw, you're being weird, what are you talking about?"""
37421,"I'm like, ""Aw..."" Pulling out my phone like a boss"
37422,YouTube 'bout to get her off
37423,"But as I type the y-o-u, some porno pop up"
37424,"I'm like, ""Hold up, how did... that's not even me"
37425,"Like, I don't jerk off mobily..."""
37426,Then her friends coming up and wanna know if everything is okay
37427,"I'm like, ""Naw, this a rape, you can't tell?"
37428,"Gimme a break, please, get the heck away"""
37429,"I turned to her, ""Let me buy you a drink,"" she like, ""Fine"""
37430,"Told the man, ""Two Patrón,"" she like, ""Lime"""
37431,"Said he tried twice, the card got declined"
37432,"I'm like, ""Alri—, is this a—"
37433,"Could it be a machine issue?"" He was like, ""Naw,"""
37434,"I was like, ""Obviously there's something wrong"
37435,"I got dough, like I'm not broke..."
37436,"I got doughnuts with the same card like about an hour ago"""
37437,"He like, ""Dude, I don't know"""
37438,Now I'm looking at the girl she just wanna go
37439,"And I ain't talking 'bout with me, bro, I mean alone"
37440,I got one more chance to prove myself
37441,So I'm like
37442,"""Look, I'm athletic, girl, I've gotten several Rec League MVP's"
37443,"At my crib, I've got some pizza, plus a little bit of weed"
37444,"In my room, I've got a TV, plus I recently did sheets"
37445,"Girl, I even have a fridge that has the water on the door"
37446,"Like with the crushed ice"""

37456,"Tried last night, but was pushed away"
37457,But I've been acting well behaved today
37458,"I smell okay, Adele Pandora's playing"
37459,Now she laying on the floor
37460,"And I'm praying this bitch is horny, I go and give her a smooch"
37461,"She kissing Dicky back, so I play with her boobs"
37462,"Bad move, she don't like that"

37470,"""Okay, I guess I forgot,"" she like, ""Dude, that's my other boss"""
37471,"""Okay, true, so shouldn't your first boss"

37481,"""Look, I just turned off The Departed for a movie 'bout a bee"

37533,I swear this the most that I've felt so damn exposed
37534,Oh yeah there's one more thing
37535,And I know this shit gonna sound insane
37536,But I still haven't hit it
37537,"I admit it, I wish I was kidding"
37538,Never been up inside before
37539,Because she's only fucked one guy before
37540,And though I really wanna boink this whore
37541,She my sweetie 3.14
37542,So I'm stayin patient and masturbating
37543,And now my heart is sorta racing
37544,Cause she said tonight will be the night we do some fornicating
37545,"Hell yeah, I'm down, I'm 'bout to go all out"
37546,"I'm gonna pound that crazy, like an elaborate black man handshake"
37547,"But on the way to crib, we pass this kid"
37548,And he seem to know who Katie is
37549,"So I say ""Who this?"" and she say"
37550,"""Dicky, this is my ex-boyfriend Jim!"""
37551,And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
37552,"But as I'm looking at this dude, I can't believe my eyes"
37553,'Cause he's the best looking guy that I've seen in my whole life
37554,"He's got the thickest head of hair, chiseled jaw, an egregious bod"
37555,"Man, this the closest thing I've seen to a Grecian god"
37556,"And now I'm lookin at my chick, cause his dick's been inside her raw"
37557,"Aw, damn"
37558,Man this is crazy
37559,I can't believe this guy used to fuck my lady
37560,I bet he left that pussy ravaged like Haiti
37561,Katie's hugging and squeezing his shoulder blades
37562,"And I'm buggin and queasy, this ain't okay"
37563,"And then they say, ""Let's get drinks"" so I say ""Okay"""
37564,Even though I was about to get laid!
37565,Man this muhfucker look like Ashton
37566,Combined wit a lil Hugh Jackman
37567,"In other words, he's so damn attractive"
37568,"So damn tan, he gotta have a little black in him"
37569,"Now I'm in the back wit him, sippin on some 'gnac wit him"
37570,"And he payin for it all, he investment banking"
37571,I'm acting like I ain't distracted
37572,But I'm reenacting him and Katie bangin'
37573,"And now I'm feelin' pissed, so I go and take a piss"
37574,"Midstream, I look left and guess who it is"
37575,"And I had to see, and I was mad discreet"
37576,And I got on my tippy toes and I took a little peek
37577,"""Oh my god becky, look at that cock!"""
37578,And I ain't usually the one to be the jealous type
37579,"But as I'm lookin at his dick, I can't believe me eyes"
37580,Because he's got the biggest cock that I've seen in my whole life
37581,And now I'm starin at this dude's soft dick with a lot of hate
37582,Because the shit is plus 8 like Jon and Kate
37583,And I don't know if I can date my girl after tonight
37584,"Aw, damn"
37585,"I don't know what to do, dude's dick is really huge"
37586,I didn't realize a penis could be so smooth
37587,"I know she's missing that, my penis isn't that"
37588,"I'm looking closer, I think that his dick has abs"
37589,"Six pack on a dick, now what the fuck is that?"
37590,"It's so long and thick, It's like a punching bag"
37591,"I'm saying it's so shaven, head is amazing"
37592,Got my dick looking like a raisin
37593,"Skin tone insane, man he's hung like Saddam Hussein, it's crazy"
37594,What the fuck should I do?
37595,"He gotta Ruth's Chris dick, and mine's a drive-thru...."
37596,I think it's time to tell Katie my goodbyes
37597,'Cause I simply can't survive
37598,After seeing what was in between his thighs
37599,So I tell her
37600,"""That this dude's got a dick that I don't comprehend"
37601,I had to move my neck to see it end to end
37602,I mean the physics of his dick just don't make any sense
37603,And I think it's for the best if this comes to an end
37604,Because the sex with him must have been the best
37605,And I would say let's just be friends
37606,"But I think I would just think about his dick all the time, so goodbye"""
37607,"Then she told me, ""Dicky, I don't really know what to say"
37608,Because I dated this dude in the second grade
37609,"So I don't know about his dick, now let's go home and get you laid"""
37610,"And then I took her to my crib, and you know that we belly slapped"
37611,And I gave her an O like I was selling crack
37612,"And when I came, I pulled out and nutted all over her left thigh"
37613,"And upper mid-section region, you can call that the pelvis"
37614,Some would even call that the pubic bone
37615,"Leave the pubes at home, making this up on the spot"
37616,Fuck you know about it?
37617,I'm about to go papier-mâché my dick and ride it
37618,"Aw, fuck, I think I just actually said I was about to"
37619,Make a papier-mâché version of my own dick and ride it
37620,"And I could understand how that, that could sound gay"
37621,"But, like, you gotta realize that I was just freestylin'"
37622,So like I wasn't really in control of what I was sayin'
37623,"And, I mean, 'cause it ain't me, I, I"
37624,"Real rap I am about to papier-mâché my dick, I won't even lie about that"
37625,"I got, you know, the ingredients is right in front of me like laid out"
37626,"Like, no bullshit, newspaper"
37627,"I don't even know what the fuck you would call that shit, putty I guess"
37628,"It's about to get real sexual up in here, huh"
37629,"But I am not gon' ride it, that, that ain't me"
37630,"I mean that's how I free, it came off the, the, the brain"
37631,"Yeah, you know, if I, if I was thinkin' that then it is what it is but I, I, I ain't gon' act on it"
37632,"Heh, you know what I'm sayin', I ain't gonna act on that shit"
37633,"But I am about to put that shit on the wall, though"
37634,"The, uh, the papier-mâché, cast mold of my dick, so, there's that"
37635,"All right, holla at me"
37636,"Bruh, bruh, bruh"
37637,"LD, aka stem cells"
37638,Everybody know the cat like a dope meme

37646,"On that note, I got the fellas saying ""What up,"" the tape, what up?"
37647,The same motherfucker playing with his steak cut up
37648,"I'm great, shut up, the flowing, no debate, just us"

37853,There ain't a better time than today
37854,"But maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah"
37855,Instead of always trying to figure everything out
37856,And all I do is say sorry
37857,Half the time I don't even know what I'm saying it about
37858,"Good news, good news, good news"
37859,That's all they wanna hear
37860,"No, they don't like you when I'm down"

37867,Hope I make it home from work
37868,"Well, so tired of being so tired"

37872,Maybe 'cause it ain't
37873,I just love the way it sound when I say it
37874,"Yeah, it's what I do"
37875,"If you know me, it ain't anything new"

37877,"But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah"
37878,I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
37879,And that's a problem with a closed door
37880,"Good news, good news, good news"
37881,That's all they wanna hear
37882,"No, they don't like you when I'm down"
37883,"But when I'm flying, oh"
37884,It make 'em so uncomfortable
37885,"So different, what's the difference?"
37886,There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
37887,I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
37888,"I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time"
37889,I'll finally discover
37890,That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
37891,That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
37892,"I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time"
37893,Then I'll finally discover
37894,"That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad"
37895,"Well, it ain't that bad, mm"
37896,At least it don't gotta be no more
37897,"No more, no more, no more, no more"
37898,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no"
37899,"Hey, hey"

37908,"I got a system filled up with toxins, I've been broken-hearted, now it's fuck that bitch"
37909,"Getting high to deal with my problems, fucking bitches, getting drunk as shit"
37910,"But these bitches getting obnoxious, they nuttin' to me though, I love this shit"
37911,"Go long days, longer nights, talk too much, the wrong advice, all the lights"
37912,"And call my life, doctor, doctor, will you help me? Get me healthy, keep it low, this where hell be"
37913,"Ain't shit you can tell me now, fuck this rap shit, bitch, I'm sellin' out"

37969,I wish you caught me on a different day
37970,When it was easier to be happy
37971,Just a little taste and you know she got you
37972,Can you hide away? Can you hide away?
37973,Sound of silence as they all just watch you

38032,Have a ball with a dribble and bounce
38033,"'Cause the party ain't over 'til they're kickin' me out, yeah"

40743,"Holla, holla, holla, holla at your boy"
40744,Like your dad when he's pissed off
40745,"Got flow, I could make a cripple crip walk"
40746,"Niggas' breath stank, all they do is shit talk"
40747,"People want a real man, I made 'em wait this long"
40748,"Maybe if he bombs, he'll quit and keep actin'"
40749,And save paper like your aunt does with McDonald napkins
40750,How'd it happen? Honesty did it
40751,See all of my competition at the bodies exhibit
40752,"Yeah, I bodied the limits and I deaded them fakers"
40753,"Motherfuck if you hate it, cremated them haters"
40754,"So, my studio be a funeral"
40755,"Yeah, this is our year, oh you didn't know?"
40756,"Uh, yeah I'm killin' you, step inside the lion's den"
40757,Man I'm Hov if the 'O' was an 'I' instead
40758,On stage wit' my family in front of me
40759,I am what I am: everything I wanna be
40760,"All these haters, see you later"
40761,"All that I could do, but you don't even feel me though"
40762,I know you know I know you got that power
40763,That power
40764,"Oh, oh oh"
40765,This is on a bus back from camp
40766,I’m thirteen and so are you
40767,Before I left for camp I imagined it would be me and three or four other dudes
40768,"I hadn’t met yet, running around all summer, getting into trouble"
40769,It turned out it would be me and just one girl. That’s you
40770,And we’re still at camp as long as we’re on the bus
40771,And not at the pickup point where our parents would be waiting for us
40772,We’re still wearing our orange camp t-shirts. We still smell like pineneedles
40773,I like you and you like me and I more-than-like you
40774,But I don’t know if you do or don’t more-than-like me
40775,"You’ve never said, so I haven’t been saying anything all summer"
40776,Content to enjoy the small miracle of a girl choosing to talk to me
40777,And choosing to do so again the next day and so on
40778,"A girl who’s smart and funny and who, if I say something dumb for a laugh"
40779,Is willing to say something two or three times as dumb to make me laugh
40780,But who also gets weird and wise sometimes in a way I could never be
40781,A girl who reads books that no one’s assigned to her
40782,Whose curly brown hair has a line running through it
40783,From where she put a tie to hold it up while it was still wet
40784,Back in the real world we don’t go to the same school
40785,And unless one of our families moves to a dramatically different neighborhood
40786,We won’t go to the same high school
40787,"So, this is kind of it for us. Unless I say something"
40788,And it might especially be it for us if I actually do say something
40789,The sun’s gone down and the bus is quiet. A lot of kids are asleep
40790,We’re talking in whispers about a tree we saw at a rest stop
40791,That looks like a kid we know
40792,"And then I’m like, “Can I tell you something?”"
40793,And all of a sudden I’m telling you
40794,And I keep telling you and it all comes out of me and it keeps coming
40795,And your face is there and gone and there and gone
40796,As we pass underneath the orange lamps that line the sides of the highway
40797,And there’s no expression on it
40798,And I think just after a point I’m just talking to lengthen the time
40799,Where we live in a world where you haven’t said “yes” or “no” yet
40800,And regrettably I end up using the word “destiny”
40801,I don’t remember in what context. Doesn’t really matter
40802,"Before long I’m out of stuff to say and you smile and say, “okay”"
40803,"I don’t know exactly what you mean by it, but it seems vaguely positive"
40804,And I would leave in order not to spoil the moment
40805,But there’s nowhere to go because we’re on a bus
40806,"So I pretend like I’m asleep and before long, I really am"
40807,"I wake up, the bus isn’t moving anymore"
40808,The domed lights that line the center aisle are all on
40809,I turn and you’re not there
40810,Then again a lot of kids aren’t in their seats anymore
40811,"We’re parked at the pick-up point, which is in the parking lot of a Methodist church"
40812,The bus is half empty. You might be in your dad’s car by now
40813,Your bags and things piled high in the trunk
40814,The girls in the back of the bus are shrieking and laughing and taking their sweet time
40815,Disembarking as I swing my legs out into the aisle to get up off the bus
40816,Just as one of them reaches my row
40817,"It used to be our row, on our way off"
40818,"It’s Michelle, a girl who got suspended from third grade for a week"
40819,After throwing rocks at my head
40820,Adolescence is doing her a ton of favors body-wise
40821,She stops and looks down at me
40822,"And her head is blasted from behind by the dome light, so I can’t really see her face"
40823,But I can see her smile. And she says one word: “destiny”
40824,Then her and the girls clogging the aisles behind her all laugh
40825,And then she turns and leads them off the bus
40826,I didn’t know you were friends with them
40827,I find my dad in the parking lot. He drives me back to our house and camp is over
40828,"So is summer, even though there’s two weeks until school starts"
40829,This isn’t a story about how girls are evil or how love is bad
40830,This is a story about how I learned something and I’m not saying this thing is true or not
40831,I’m just saying it’s what I learned
40832,I told you something. It was just for you and you told everybody
40833,"So I learned cut out the middle man, make it all for everybody, always"
40834,"Everybody can’t turn around and tell everybody, everybody already knows, I told them"
40835,But this means there isn’t a place in my life for you or someone like you
40836,Is it sad? Sure. But it’s a sadness I chose
40837,I wish I could say this was a story about how I got on the bus a boy
40838,"And got off a man more cynical, hardened, and mature and shit"
40839,But that’s not true. The truth is I got on the bus a boy. And I never got off the bus
40840,I still haven’t
40841,You can feel it in the streets
40842,"On a day like this, the heat"
40843,It feel like summer
40844,I feel like summer
40845,I feel like summer
40846,You can feel it in the streets
40847,"On a day like this, the heat"
40848,I feel like summer
40849,She feel like summer
40850,This feel like summer
40851,I feel like summer
40852,Seven billion souls that move around the sun
40853,"Rolling faster, fast and not a chance to slow down"
40854,Slow down
40855,Men who made machines that want what they decide
40856,Parents tryna tell their children please slow down
40857,Slow down

40859,"Oh, I know you know that pain"
40860,I'm hopin' that this world will change

40867,Every day gets hotter than the one before
40868,"Running out of water, it's about to go down"
40869,Go down
40870,Air that kill the bees that we depend upon
40871,Birds were made for singing
40872,Waking up to no sound
40873,No sound
40874,I know
40875,"Oh, I know you know my pain"
40876,I'm hopin' that this world will change
40877,But it just seems the same
40878,I know
40879,"Oh, I hope we change"
40880,I really thought this world could change
40881,But it seems like the same
40882,I know
40883,"Oh, my mind is still the same"
40884,I'm hoping that this world will change
40885,But it just seems the same

40887,"Oh, I hope we change"
40888,"Baby, you're the baddest"

41163,EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY
41164,"A white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, A LITTLE BOY steps off. He's walking slow and somber"
41165,All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids. Lots of kids are laughing. The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end
41166,A chauffeur  stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy
41167,CHAUFFEUR: Ey! Look who it is
41168,"He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo"
41169,The Boy's FATHER  is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off
41170,The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours
41171,FATHER: How was camp?
41172,"The Boy ""shrugs"""
41173,FATHER : You make any friends?
41174,THE BOY: No
41175,The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh
41176,FATHER: Elise made you something special tonight
41177,THE BOY: Frito pie
41178,FATHER: I don't know. She didn't say-
41179,THE BOY : It's Frito pie
41180,"Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window"
41181,EXT. MANSION - DAY
41182,"The Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home. The Mansion is dope. Very Big, and not gaudy. It looks classic"
41183,INT. MANSION - DAY
41184,"An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care"
41185,The Father's phone rings:
41186,FATHER: Hello
41187,"PHONE VOICE: Hello, this is the Califax collection-"
41188,Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off
41189,"The Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out"
41190,INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY
41191,"The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground. We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice"
41192,The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics
41193,"He starts checking his mail. His friend ""FAM"" sent him something that says ""this is you"" with a link. The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video"
41194,"He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as ""VERY HOTTTTTTT"". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying"
41195,"""This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! "" is the top comment"
41196,"The Boy stares. Then types ""fuck u niggers"" in the comments"
41197,He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart
41198,"He refreshes the page. People immediately respond with ""Fuck U"", ""You wouldn't say that to my face faggot"", and ""LMFAO crackers b crazy"""

41201,INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING
41202,"The room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer"
41203,"There is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has ""hackz"" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk"
41204,"There's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz ""Demon Days"" poster, and a ""Black Dynamite"" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf. Norman Connors ""You Are My Starship"" is the album on top of the others"
41205,Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor. Same pile of shoes is there. Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right
41206,"The Boy  is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts. He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up"
41207,INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY
41208,The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen
41209,INT. KITCHEN - DAY
41210,"The kitchen is a slight mess. Things left out. S'mores makings left out. The marshmallows are hard as stones. The boy goes into the cabinet and pulls out a pop tart. He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave, wrapper still on . He starts the microwave and begins texting someone. The microwave is okay for about 5 seconds, then blue sparks start to pop inside. He turns off the microwave, opens it, grabs the pop tart and tosses it on a plate"
41211,EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING
41212,"The Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background. The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there. There's an orchard with lemon and plums to the west of the wall outside, and a green statue of a golfer further in. Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background"
41213,"The boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat. He gets a text message:"
41214,FAM: when u wanna paddle out?

41220,THE BOY: Nah
41221,"FAM: Really, mane? You want us to drive around in my car? I don't think it'll make it, honestly. It broke down at my mom's. Plus... it looks like my car"
41222,THE BOY: Right. It's inconspicuous
41223,"FAM: My nigga, who are you hiding from? It's not stuttin. It's your car. Why do you even care?"
41224,"""...why do you even care?"""
41225,THE BOY: Aight
41226,INT. GARAGE - MORNING
41227,"The garage door rises to reveal Fam and The Boy's silhouette. Five cars are in the garage. There's a Tesla Model S, Silver 911, some car no one's ever seen, a Tahoe and some car under a tarp. Looks like it could be an Aston Martin. Fam smiles"
41228,FAM : That one-
41229,THE BOY: No
41230,THE BOY: The Bimmer
41231,"We didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head"
41232,FAM: Nah...nah
41233,They get in the 911
41234,CUT TO:
41235,EXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY
41236,The 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk
41237,"SOMEONE FROM A WINDOW: I work nights, dickhead!"
41238,"FAM: I know. Fuck me, right?"
41239,Fam honks more
41240,"The Boy checks his Twitter feed. Twitter name ""You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar"" You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite. He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights"
41241,He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...
41242,"...someone tweeted ""roscoe's wetsuit"""
41243,"""...what's that?"""
41244,"The Boy drops ""roscoe's wetsuit"" into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it. The answer to ""what is roscoe's wetsuit?"" is...""roscoe's wetsuit"". Hilarious"
41245,"SWANK, STEVE, MARCUS , and AJ  walk out of the condo. They have longboards with them and they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when they see the 911"
41246,SWANK : How we supposed to get these in there?
41247,FAM: You guys take your car
41248,STEVE: What about your boards? Where are they?
41249,FAM: Can we borrow some?
41250,They all make a face
41251,SWANK: We need a bigger car then. I'ma drive to your house and get the Tahoe
41252,"THE BOY: Come on, guys. This is taking forever"

41257,SOMEONE AGAIN: Shut the fuck up!
41258,Fam honks the horn
41259,SWANK: I'm drivin that Porsche the way back. I know that shit
41260,Swank and Steve walk toward their car parked on the street
41261,"THE BOY: What's ""roscoe's wetsuit"" mean?"
41262,FAM: I don't know
41263,They drive off
41264,EXT. DOCKWEILER BEACH - DAY
41265,"The guys carry the boards through the sand to ocean, making a strange pattern behind them"
41266,They setup camp and start changing on the beach
41267,MARCUS: I thought someone was bringing girls
41268,THE BOY: No one wants to get up this early
41269,MARCUS: Did you ask white girls?
41270,THE BOY: I asked every girl
41271,FAM: You a lie. You didn't ask anybody. You don't leave the house
41272,STEVE: Why white girls?
41273,"MARCUS: Cause no one is getting up at 6AM to go into the freezing, dirty ass ocean, fuck up their hair-"
41274,"At that moment, they all notice a girl sitting on her board in the ocean. Waiting for a wave she looks behind her. She is black"
41275,MARCUS : See? This is what I mean about Donnie Darko happening to me
41276,A plane flies low overhead.
41277,MARCUS
41278,It's gonna crush me
41279,SWANK : It's like seeing a mermaid
41280,STEVE: Maybe it's a manatee
41281,MARCUS : I'ma flirt

41298,SASHA: Yes
41299,Steve splashes Marcus
41300,Swank takes a plastic bag with four blunts in it. He takes one out. He lights up a blunt. Talks with it hanging in his mouth
41301,SWANK: How long you been surfing?
41302,SASHA: Ten years. You?
41303,SWANK: Bouta month
41304,AJ: Cops don't come out here. It's a good place to smoke. You want some?
41305,He passes it. She takes a hit
41306,SWANK: What you doin tonight?
41307,SASHA: My friend's birthday in Santa Monica
41308,"MARCUS: Yo, we're right around close. We're having a party tonight in a mansion. You should come. And if your friend's a girl or a guy who has weed, they should come too"
41309,"AJ: I'm Djing. I start off with Jodeci, then the switch over to 90's rap using ""Dream Lover"" to transition, play ACTUAL ATLANTA TRAP for an hour, hour and a half. Then motown, soul, and house. Girls. Go. Crazy"

41312,SASHA: I'ma go in
41313,Sasha starts paddling and catches a wave into the beach
41314,"AJ: I shouldn't have said ""bitches"""
41315,MARCUS : ...you didn't
41316,AJ thinks on this. This is probably saying more about him than he realizes
41317,EXT. BEACH - MORNING
41318,Sasha carries her board onto the beach. The Boy is sitting there
41319,SASHA: You goin in?

41347,Some guys in a black SUV rolls by and yell at the dude next to The Boy
41348,MAN IN CAR: Dont let me catch you out here Jay! Don't let me catch you!
41349,The Boy watches this for a second. He looks down for a moment...
41350,"Someone has spray painted ""roscoe's wetsuit"" on the sidewalk. He stares at it"
41351,"MAN IN CAR : I got yours, muthafucka!"
41352,The Boy snaps out of it. Then takes out his phone and starts recording the fight. Fam walks out and sees the fight in action

41355,POP. POP
41356,..what's happening?
41357,Jay is bleeding from his stomach. The Boy is seeing this through his phone. It takes a moment for him to realize-
41358,POP. POP
41359,...run. now
41360,Fam is already running. Everyone in the line is screaming and running. The Boy runs
41361,COP: Drop your weapon!

41363,"Runs to the side of the building. The SUV that was firing slows down. The driver is dead. Car horn blares as the car slows to a stop, mixing with girls crying and ""oh shit!"" and ""fuck"". Jay is very close to dead. The blood on the sidewalk is almost black. A street sign  is reflected in the dark blood. He turns to The Boy, looks around. He knows what's happening. He's leaving"
41364,"That was the end. He'll never read this sentence. Or any sentence. He ended earlier. Before this sentence. As far as he knows, before any sentence. He's back to his/the natural state"
41365,The Boy felt something
41366,"It's funny, cause this dude is dead. There really isn't a connection...it's more him seeing himself for the first time since-"

41395,THE BOY: Yeah. Isn't that sad?
41396,FAM: Sad? We are making moves. What about that line me and Swank are gonna start selling?
41397,THE BOY: All we did was print shirts for ourselves. Who else is buying that shit? And the whole reason we wanted to make shirts is cause Tre made some and they were dope
41398,FAM: I don't know what to tell you. We are doing dope shit. We are making moves. We can do whatever we want-
41399,THE BOY: But none of it matters cause we're doing it for ourselves! We're just jerking off for each other. No one in the future's gonna give a shit I made a shirt once

42399,"Shawty, we got so high"
42400,Firefly
42401,Skateboardin' down at Washington Square
42402,Lookin' for quarters
42403,"Maybe afford a falafel for dinner, uh"
42404,"I’m so broke man, scholarship apologin'"
42405,Facebook messages from college kids who hollerin'
42406,"Girls like, ""We love you, we go to LSU,"""
42407,"""You gotta do a show so we can come and molest you!"""
42408,This rap stuff is magic

42410,I used to get more laughs when I got laughed at
42411,"""Oh, you got a mixtape? That's fantastic!"""

42440,"You don't speak to the hood, man"""
42441,"If I was given one chance I think I could, man"
42442,"These black kids want somethin' new, I swear it"
42443,Somethin' they wanna say but couldn't cause they embarrassed
42444,All I do is make the stuff I would've liked
42445,"Reference things I wanna watch, reference girls I wanna bite"
42446,Now I'm firefly like a burning kite

42494,Hangin' out with Questlove reminiscin' 'bout Whitney
42495,"He like, ""Man, we can't even make it to 50?!"""
42496,"That reminds me, I sent a long text message to my mom and pop"
42497,I got the same speech when I left 30 Rock
42498,"My mom like, ""Why you wanna leave a good job?"""
42499,"My dad like, ""Do your thing, boy, don't stop"""
42500,"Shout out to my nigga Lud, shout out to my nigga Swank"
42501,For hangin' at the crib and telling me what you think
42502,Speak from your heart and never compromise what you feel is real
42503,And never let these white people tell you how to feel
42504,Never let anybody tell you how to feel
42505,I wanted what they had back in the fourth grade
42506,"Family vacays, you know I did it all"
42507,Just to see my little sis by a waterfall
42508,My great granddad bought his own freedom
42509,Walk barefoot to Virginia to start his own peanut farm
42510,"So don't be alarmed, man, I'm royalty"

42518,DG Lover ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
42519,D-Money ain't nothin' to fuck wit'
42520,And what's a leader if he isn't reluctant?
42521,"Too bad for y'all, I'm blastin' off"
42522,"I'm not Asher Roth, I don't sleep on my bread"
42523,"Dick riders stay close, I might flash a ball"
42524,"Sometimes, all this shit make a nigga feel guilty"
42525,I used to sleep with them roaches
42526,"Back of my mind though, I hope the show gets canceled"
42527,Maybe then I can focus
42528,"Hawaii touch down, go ahead baby, put your shades on"
42529,East Side! East Side to the gravestone!
42530,"Brown liquor, but my girl in Bed-Stuy"
42531,"Nigga, you got Drive like a sale at Best Buy, uh"
42532,"Hold up, hold up, we can do better"
42533,"Put my voice on the track, man, that shit is much wetter"
42534,At the studio at 8 AM
42535,"Hit the booth then eat, nigga, we ain't them, nigga, we ain't them!"
42536,"Drop a line, it's your Facebook status"
42537,"Said that shit about a week ago, you still mad at us"
42538,"If there's something on your chest, nigga, let it out"
42539,"'Cause I'm the best, da-da-da"
42540,"Oh, I want it, yeah"

42546,"Yeah, uh"
42547,Why in the fuck these niggas
42548,"Try and hold me down, ohh"
42549,"""You such a fuckin' lame!"""
42550,It's what they used to yell back in seventh grade
42551,My mama said she'd get me that new jacket when the cost go down
42552,"Hit the office, stole some Tommy Hill from lost and found"
42553,Not bad for a family of foster child
42554,"Lookin' fly man, I'm flossin' now"
42555,But them niggas saw through me
42556,"""Are you serious? What is this?"""
42557,"Took the jacket off third period, ellipsis"
42558,"Listening to ""Sky Is the Limit"" on my Walkman"
42559,"Thinking if Biggie can make it through it, man then I can"
42560,"Dope-boy swag, I always wanted that"
42561,But my persona was always more of that Arthur Ashe
42562,But no love for the son of a commuter who was a radio head
42563,And okay at them computers at the post office
42564,It's funny how you smoke niggas then you start coffins
42565,All my people need throat lozenge
42566,"My fear is dead, ambition drove the hearse"
42567,But niggas got me feelin' I ain't black enough to go to church
42568,Culture shock at barber shops cause I ain't hood enough
42569,"We all look the same to the cops, ain't that good enough?"
42570,The black experience is black and serious
42571,"Cause being black, my experience, is no one hearin' us"
42572,White kids get to wear whatever hat they want
42573,When it comes to black kids one size fits all
42574,"Oh, I want it, yeah"
42575,Whenever you need my hand
42576,"I'll hold you down, oh"
42577,"Oh, you want it, yeah"

42583,"We the baddest nigga, we the baddest nigga, uh"
42584,"We the baddest nigga, uh, we the baddest nigga"
42585,The reason that they say I'm nothin' what they seen or heard's
42586,The same reason Will Smith always opposite Latino girls
42587,They only see you how they wanna see you
42588,'Til you make them see you in some other way
42589,I'm trippin' off the other day
42590,'Cause God knows what these white kids sayin' dude
42591,You're not not racist 'cause The Wire's in your Netflix queue
42592,"Subtle racism, it's hard to pin it"
42593,'Cause you'd only understand if you were me for just a minute
42594,This one kid said somethin' that was really bad
42595,He said I wasn't really black because I had a dad
42596,I think that's kinda sad
42597,Mostly 'cause a lot of black kids think they should agree with that
42598,"If you're a father, you should stick around if you could"
42599,"'Cause even if you're bad at it, you could Tiger Woods or MJ"
42600,"We warriors, we all need senseis"
42601,Change everything that we've done so far
42602,I don't mean makin' B.E.T. T.E.R
42603,I mean just the way that we see each other
42604,I won't stop until they say:

42606,"Yeah, these niggas wanted Cookie, but instead I gave 'em Loch Ness"
42607,"Sick Boi for life, my swag is in a hospice"

42631,"Playing Lil Durk, ""Dis Ain't What U Want"""
42632,"Look at my feet, I put my sneakers in the trunk"
42633,Pass a Fatburger through Atwater village
42634,"Laugh for a minute, couldn't cry for the life of me"
42635,"Park by the bridge, sit on the hood"
42636,"Look at the cars, stare at my hands, look at the moon"
42637,"I can't find it, it's gone, what's wrong?"
42638,"""Didn't respond when I texted you last night"""
42639,"""You alright?""—yeah..."
42640,"Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away"
42641,"I'm a murderer, what can I say?"
42642,"Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away"
42643,"I'm a murderer, what does that change?"
42644,Man is a star bound to a body inside of me
42645,"20 million degrees, burn a man to his knees"
42646,Late at night in a hurry bought a McFlurry
42647,"And half of an apple pie, when I'm laughing, I'm satisfied"
42648,"When I'm dying, I'm still alive, strange position"
42649,"I'm in a good mood, so good, I'ma kill that spider"
42650,In spite of the kinda things that they told me
42651,Alone don't mean that you lonely
42652,"Alone means you finally get it, admit it"
42653,"Go home, lock up the door, fold up the clothes"
42654,"Watch some cartoons, turn off the lights"
42655,"Look at the recluse, look at the recluse"
42656,"Look at the recluse, look at the rec—"
42657,"Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away"
42658,"I'm a murderer, what can I say?"
42659,"Don't go, gotta know, please don't run away"
42660,"I'm a murderer, what does that change?"
42661,"Don't go, don't go"
42662,"Don't go, don't go-ooo"
42663,"Han, hey"

42684,"Yeah, I say, bitch bad"
42685,"Woman good, lady better"
42686,"Hey, hey, hey, hey"
42687,"Now imagine there's a shorty, maybe five, maybe four"
42688,Riding 'round with his mama listening to the radio
42689,And a song comes on and a not far off from being born
42690,Doesn't know the difference between right and wrong
42691,"Now, I ain't trying to make it too complex"
42692,But let's just say shorty has an undeveloped context
42693,About the perception of women these days
42694,"His mama sings along, and this what she says"
42695,"""Niggas, I'm a bad bitch, and I'm bad, bitch!"
42696,"Somethin' that's far above average."""
42697,"And maybe other rhyming words like ""cabbage"" and ""savage"""
42698,"And ""baby carriage"" and other things that match it"
42699,Couple of things are happenin' here
42700,"First he's relatin' the word bitch with his mama, comma"
42701,And because she's relatin' to herself
42702,As most important source of help
42703,"And mental health, he may skew respect for dishonor"
42704,"Bitch bad, woman good"
42705,"Lady better, they misunderstood"
42706,"Uh, tell 'em, bitch bad"
42707,"Woman good, lady better"
42708,They misunderstood
42709,They misunderstood
42710,"Yeah, now imagine a group of little girls nine through 12"
42711,"On the Internet watching videos, listening to songs by themselves"
42712,It doesn't really matter if they have parental clearance
42713,They understand the Internet better than their parents
42714,"Now, being the Internet, the content's probably uncensored"
42715,"They're young, so they're malleable and probably unmentored"
42716,"A complicated combination, maybe with no relevance"
42717,Until that intelligence meets their favorite singer's preference
42718,"""Bad bitches, bad bitches, bad bitches"
42719,"That's all I want and all I like in life is bad bitches, bad bitches."""
42720,"Now, let's say that they less concerned with him"
42721,And more with the video girl acquiescent to his whims
42722,"Ah, the plot thickens: high heels, long hair, fat booty, slim"
42723,"Reality check, I'm not trippin'"
42724,"They don't see a paid actress, just what makes a bad bitch"
42725,"Bitch bad, woman good"
42726,"Lady better, they misunderstood"

49041,Kim's the first girl I kissed
49042,I was so nervous that I nearly missed
49043,She's had a couple of kids since then
49044,I haven't seen her since God knows when
49045,"Oh, oh, oh"
49046,"Oh, God, I, I"
49047,Every memory of looking out the back door
49048,I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
49049,"It's hard to say it, time to say it"
49050,"Goodbye, goodbye"
49051,Every memory of walking out the front door
49052,I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
49053,"It's hard to say it, time to say it"
49054,"Goodbye, goodbye"
49055,I miss that town
49056,I miss their faces
49057,You can't erase
49058,You can't replace it
49059,I miss it now
49060,I can't believe it
49061,So hard to stay
49062,Too hard to leave it
49063,"If I could, I'd relive those days"
49064,I know the one thing that would never change
49065,Every memory of looking out the back door
49066,I had the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor
49067,"It's hard to say it, time to say it"
49068,"Goodbye, goodbye"
49069,Every memory of walking out the front door
49070,I found the photo of the friend that I was looking for
49071,"It's hard to say it, time to say it"
49072,"Goodbye, goodbye"
49073,Look at this photograph
49074,"Every time I do, it makes me laugh"
49075,"Every time I do, it makes me"
49076,"This time, this place"
49077,"Misused, mistakes"
49078,"Too long, too late"
49079,Who was I to make you wait?
49080,"Just one chance, just one breath"
49081,Just in case there's just one left
49082,'Cause you know
49083,"You know, you know"
49084,I love you
49085,I loved you all along
49086,And I miss you
49087,Been far away for far too long
49088,I keep dreaming you'll be with me
49089,And you'll never go
49090,Stop breathing
49091,If I don't see you anymore
49092,"On my knees, I'll ask"
49093,Last chance for one last dance
49094,"'Cause with you, I'd withstand"
49095,All of Hell to hold your hand
49096,"I'd give it all, I'd give for us"
49097,"Give anything, but I won't give up"
49098,'Cause you know
49099,"You know, you know"
49100,I love you
49101,I loved you all along
49102,And I miss you
49103,Been far away for far too long
49104,I keep dreaming you'll be with me
49105,And you'll never go
49106,Stop breathing
49107,If I don't see you anymore
49108,So far away (So far away)
49109,Been far away for far too long
49110,So far away (So far away)
49111,Been far away for far too long
49112,But you know
49113,"You know, you know"
49114,I wanted
49115,I wanted you to stay
49116,'Cause I needed
49117,I need to hear you say
49118,That I love you (I love you)
49119,I loved you all along
49120,And I forgive you (I forgive you)
49121,For being away for far too long
49122,So keep breathing
49123,'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
49124,Believe it
49125,"Hold on to me, and never let me go"
49126,Keep breathing
49127,'Cause I'm not leaving you anymore
49128,Believe it
49129,"Hold on to me, never let me go"
49130,Keep breathing
49131,"Hold on to me, never let me go"
49132,Keep breathing
49133,"Hold on to me, never let me go"
49134,My best friend gave me the best advice
49135,He said each day's a gift and not a given right
49136,"Leave no stone unturned, leave your fears behind"
49137,And try to take the path less traveled by
49138,That first step you take is the longest stride
49139,"(What if, what if?)"
49140,If today was your last day
49141,And tomorrow was too late
49142,"Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)"
49143,Would you live each moment like your last?
49144,Leave old pictures in the past?
49145,Donate every dime you have?
49146,"(What if, what if?)"
49147,If today was your last day
49148,"(What if, what if?)"
49149,(If today was your last day)
49150,Against the grain should be a way of life
49151,What's worth the prize is always worth the fight
49152,Every second counts 'cause there's no second try
49153,So live like you'll never live it twice
49154,Don't take the free ride in your own life
49155,"(What if, what if?)"
49156,If today was your last day
49157,And tomorrow was too late
49158,"Could you say goodbye to yesterday? (What if, what if?)"
49159,Would you live each moment like your last?
49160,Leave old pictures in the past?
49161,"Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)"
49162,And would you call old friends you never see?
49163,Reminisce old memories?
49164,"Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)"
49165,Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
49166,Swear up and down to God above
49167,That you finally fall in love? (That you finally fall in love)
49168,If today was your last day
49169,If today was your last day
49170,Would you make your mark by mending a broken heart?
49171,You know it's never too late to shoot for the stars
49172,Regardless of who you are
49173,So do whatever it takes (Takes)
49174,'Cause you can't rewind a moment in this life
49175,Let nothin' stand in your way (Way)
49176,'Cause the hands of time are never on your side
49177,If today was your last day
49178,And tomorrow was too late
49179,Could you say goodbye to yesterday?
49180,Would you live each moment like your last?
49181,Leave old pictures in the past?
49182,"Donate every dime you have? (What if, what if?)"
49183,And would you call old friends you never see?
49184,Reminisce old memories?
49185,"Would you forgive your enemies? (What if, what if?)"
49186,Would you find that one you're dreamin' of?
49187,Swear up and down to God above
49188,"That you finally fall in love? (What if, what if?)"
49189,If today was your last day
49190,Prison gates won't open up for me
49191,"On these hands and knees, I'm crawlin'"
49192,"Oh, I reach for you"
49193,"Well, I'm terrified of these four walls"
49194,These iron bars can't hold my soul in
49195,"All I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin')"
49196,"And oh, I scream for you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')"
49197,Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
49198,And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
49199,"And say it for me, say it to me"
49200,And I'll leave this life behind me
49201,Say it if it's worth savin' me
49202,Heaven's gates won't open up for me
49203,With these broken wings I'm fallin'
49204,All I see is you
49205,These city walls ain't got no love for me
49206,I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story
49207,"Oh, I scream for you (Come, please, I'm callin')"
49208,"And all I need from you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin')"
49209,Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
49210,And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
49211,"And say it for me, say it to me"
49212,And I'll leave this life behind me
49213,Say it if it's worth savin' me
49214,"Hurry, I'm fallin'"
49215,"And all I need is you (Come, please, I'm callin')"
49216,"And oh, I scream for you (Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin')"
49217,Show me what it's like (To be the last one standing)
49218,And teach me wrong from right (And I'll show you what I can be)
49219,"And say it for me, say it to me"
49220,And I'll leave this life behind me
49221,"Say it if it's worth saving me (Hurry, I'm fallin')"
49222,"And say it for me, say it to me"
49223,And I'll leave this life behind me
49224,Say it if it's worth savin' me
49225,Addressing those beneath from high above
49226,Convincing his belief for what you love
49227,Baiting every hook with filthy lies
49228,Another charlatan to idolize
49229,Is this suppression just in my mind? (Just in my mind?)
49230,"No more questions, get back in line! (Just get back in line!)"
49231,You pay with your life
49232,"The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)"
49233,But now it's your turn
49234,"The ashes will burn, and wither away"
49235,"Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)"
49236,"And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)"
49237,The gears forever turn to grind the mice
49238,Will you become the fuel for sacrifice?
49239,Power absolutely all for show
49240,The piper blows his flute and off you go
49241,Is this obsession behind your eyes? (Behind your eyes?)
49242,"No more questions, get back in line! (Just get back in line!)"
49243,You pay with your life
49244,"The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)"
49245,But now it's your turn
49246,"The ashes will burn, and wither away"
49247,"Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)"
49248,"And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (to feed the machine)"
49249,Why must the blind always lead the blind?
49250,(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
49251,Why do I feel like the fault is mine?
49252,(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
49253,Why must the weakest be sacrificed?
49254,(Get back in line! Get back in line!)
49255,"No more questions, get back in line!"
49256,(Just get back in line!)
49257,Pay with your life
49258,"The duller the knife, the longer it takes (The longer it takes)"
49259,But now it's your turn
49260,"The ashes will burn, and wither away (Wither away)"
49261,"Leaving your bones out on the stones, picking them clean (picking them clean)"
49262,"And carving the truth, while harvesting you to feed the machine (To feed the machine)"
49263,To feed the machine
49264,"I, I'm driving black on black"
49265,Just got my license back
49266,I got this feeling in my veins this train is coming off the track
49267,I'll ask polite if the devil needs a ride
49268,'Cause the angel on my right ain't hanging out with me tonight
49269,I'm driving past your house while you were sneaking out
49270,I got the car door opened up so you can jump in on the run
49271,Your mom don't know that you were missing
49272,She'd be pissed if she could see the parts of you that I've been kissing
49273,Screamin'
49274,"No, we're never gonna quit"
49275,Ain't nothing wrong with it
49276,Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
49277,"No, no matter where we go"
49278,'Cause everybody knows
49279,We're just a couple of animals (Animals)
49280,"So come on baby, get in"
49281,"Get in, just get in"
49282,Check out the trouble we're in
49283,You're beside me on the seat
49284,Got your hand between my knees
49285,And you control how fast we go by just how hard you wanna squeeze
49286,It's hard to steer when you're breathing in my ear
49287,But I got both hands on the wheel while you got both hands on my gears
49288,"By now, no doubt that we were heading south"
49289,I guess nobody ever taught her not to speak with a full mouth
49290,"'Cause this was it, like flicking on a switch"
49291,It felt so good I almost drove into the ditch
49292,I'm screamin'
49293,"No, we're never gonna quit"
49294,Ain't nothing wrong with it
49295,Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
49296,"No, no matter where we go"
49297,'Cause everybody knows
49298,We're just a couple of animals (Animals)
49299,"So come on baby, get in"
49300,"Get in, just get in"
49301,Look at the trouble we're in
49302,We were parked out by the tracks
49303,We're sitting in the back and we just started getting busy
49304,"When she whispered ""What was that?"""
49305,"""The wind, I think 'cause no one else knows where we are"""
49306,And that was when she started screamin'
49307,"""That's my dad outside the car!"""
49308,"Oh please, the keys, they're not in the ignition"
49309,Must have wound up on the floor while we were switching our positions
49310,I guess they knew that she was missing
49311,As I tried to tell her dad it was her mouth that I was kissing
49312,Screamin'
49313,"No, we're never gonna quit"
49314,Ain't nothing wrong with it
49315,Just acting like we're animals (Animals)
49316,"No, no matter where we go"
49317,'Cause everybody knows
49318,We're just a couple of animals (Animals)
49319,"So come on baby, get in"
49320,(We're just a couple of animals)
49321,"Get in, just get in"
49322,Ain't nothing wrong with it
49323,Check out the trouble we're in
49324,(We're just a couple of animals)
49325,"Get in, just get in"
49326,"Well, I know the feeling"
49327,Of finding yourself stuck out on the ledge
49328,And there ain't no healing
49329,From cutting yourself with the jagged edge
49330,"I'm telling you that, it's never that bad"
49331,Take it from someone who's been where you're at
49332,Laid out on the floor
49333,And you're not sure you can take this anymore
49334,So just give it one more try to a lullaby
49335,And turn this up on the radio
49336,If you can hear me now
49337,I'm reaching out
49338,To let you know that you're not alone
49339,"And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell"
49340,'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
49341,So just close your eyes
49342,"Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby"
49343,Your very own lullaby
49344,Please let me take you
49345,Out of the darkness and into the light
49346,'Cause I have faith in you
49347,That you're gonna make it through another night
49348,Stop thinking about the easy way out
49349,There's no need to go and blow the candle out
49350,Because you're not done
49351,You're far too young
49352,And the best is yet to come
49353,So just give it one more try to a lullaby
49354,And turn this up on the radio
49355,If you can hear me now
49356,I'm reaching out
49357,To let you know that you're not alone
49358,"And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell"
49359,'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
49360,So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
49361,"Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby"
49362,Your very own lullaby
49363,"Well, everybody's hit the bottom"
49364,Everybody's been forgotten
49365,When everybody's tired of being alone
49366,"Yeah, everybody's been abandoned"
49367,And left a little empty handed
49368,So if you're out there barely hanging on
49369,Just give it one more try to a lullaby
49370,And turn this up on the radio
49371,If you can hear me now
49372,I'm reaching out
49373,To let you know that you're not alone
49374,"And if you can't tell, I'm scared as hell"
49375,'Cause I can't get you on the telephone
49376,So just close your eyes (Close your eyes)
49377,"Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby"
49378,Your very own lullaby
49379,"Oh, honey, here comes a lullaby"
49380,Your very own lullaby
49381,"Well, it's midnight, damn right, we're wound up too tight"
49382,"I've got a fist full of whiskey, the bottle just bit me"
49383,Oh
49384,That shit makes me bat shit crazy
49385,"We've got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out"
49386,We're going out tonight (Hey!)
49387,To kick out every light (Hey!)
49388,Take anything we want (Hey!)
49389,Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
49390,We're going till the world stops turning
49391,While we burn it to the ground tonight
49392,Ooh
49393,Ooh
49394,"We're screaming like demons, swinging from the ceiling"
49395,"I got a fist full of fifties, tequila just hit me"
49396,Oh
49397,"We got no class, no taste, no shirt, and shit faced"
49398,"We got it lined up, shot down, firing back straight crown"
49399,We're going out tonight (Hey!)
49400,To kick out every light (Hey!)
49401,Take anything we want (Hey!)

49405,Ooh
49406,Ooh
49407,"Tickin' like a time bomb, drinkin' till the nights gone"
49408,"Well, get your hands off of this glass, last call my ass"
49409,"Well, no chain, no lock, and this train won't stop"
49410,"We got no fear, no doubt, all in, balls out"
49411,We're going out tonight (Hey!)
49412,To kick out every light (Hey!)
49413,Take anything we want (Hey!)
49414,Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
49415,We're going till the world stops turning
49416,While we burn it to the ground tonight
49417,Ooh
49418,We're going out tonight (Hey!)
49419,To kick out every light (Hey!)
49420,Take anything we want (Hey!)
49421,Drink everything in sight (Hey!)
49422,We're going till the world stops turning
49423,While we burn it to the ground tonight
49424,From underneath the trees
49425,We watch the sky
49426,Confusing stars for satellites
49427,I never dreamed that you'd be mine
49428,"But here we are, we're here tonight"
49429,"Singing, Amen, I"
49430,I'm alive (I'm alive)
49431,"Singing Amen, I"
49432,I'm alive
49433,If everyone cared and nobody cried
49434,If everyone loved and nobody lied
49435,If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
49436,Then we'd see the day when nobody died
49437,And I'm singing
49438,"Amen, I, Amen, I"
49439,I'm alive
49440,"Amen, I, Amen, I, Amen, I"
49441,I'm alive
49442,"And in the air, the fireflies"
49443,Our only light in paradise
49444,We'll show the world they were wrong
49445,And teach them all to sing along
49446,"Singing Amen, I"
49447,I'm alive (I'm alive)
49448,"Singing Amen, I"
49449,I'm alive
49450,If everyone cared and nobody cried
49451,If everyone loved and nobody lied
49452,If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
49453,Then we'd see the day when nobody died
49454,If everyone cared and nobody cried
49455,If everyone loved and nobody lied
49456,If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
49457,Then we'd see the day when nobody died
49458,When nobody died
49459,And as we lie beneath the stars
49460,We realize how small we are
49461,If they could love like you and me
49462,Imagine what the world could be
49463,If everyone cared and nobody cried
49464,If everyone loved and nobody lied
49465,If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
49466,Then we'd see the day when nobody died
49467,If everyone cared and nobody cried
49468,If everyone loved and nobody lied
49469,If everyone shared and swallowed their pride
49470,Then we'd see the day when nobody died
49471,"We'd see the day, we'd see the day"
49472,When nobody died
49473,"We'd see the day, we'd see the day"
49474,When nobody died
49475,We'd see the day when nobody died
49476,How the hell'd we wind up like this?
49477,"Why weren't we able, to see the signs that we missed"
49478,And try to turn the tables
49479,"I wish you'd unclench your fists, and unpack your suitcase"
49480,Lately there's been too much of this
49481,But don't think it's too late
49482,"Nothing's wrong, just as long as you know that someday I will"
49483,"Someday, somehow"
49484,"I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now"
49485,I know you're wondering when
49486,(You're the only one who knows that)
49487,"Someday, somehow"
49488,"I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now"
49489,I know you're wondering when
49490,Well I'd hope that since we're here anyway
49491,That we could end up saying
49492,Things we've always needed to say
49493,So we could end up staying
49494,Now the story's played out like this
49495,Just like a paperback novel
49496,Let's rewrite an ending that fits
49497,Instead of a Hollywood horror
49498,"Nothing's wrong, just as long as you know that someday I will"
49499,"Someday, somehow"
49500,"I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now"
49501,I know you're wondering when
49502,(You're the only one who knows that)
49503,"Someday, somehow"
49504,"I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now"
49505,I know you're wondering when
49506,You're the only one who knows that
49507,How the hell'd we wind up like this?
49508,"Why weren't we able, to see the signs that we missed"
49509,And try to turn the tables
49510,Now the story's played out like this
49511,Just like a paperback novel
49512,Let's rewrite an ending that fits
49513,Instead of a Hollywood horror
49514,"Nothing's wrong, just as long as you know that someday I will"
49515,"Someday, somehow"
49516,"I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now"
49517,I know you're wondering when
49518,(You're the only one who knows that)
49519,"Someday, somehow"
49520,"I'm gonna make it all right, but not right now"
49521,I know you're wondering when
49522,(You're the only one who knows that)
49523,I know you're wondering when
49524,(You're the only one who knows that)
49525,I know you're wondering when
49526,Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body
49527,"They say it’s over budget, but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on"
49528,Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene
49529,"If Hollywood had called her, she'd be gone before you hollered, come on"
49530,Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
49531,Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long
49532,"Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody"
49533,Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along
49534,(You naughty thing)
49535,"You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey"
49536,(You naughty woman)
49537,You shake your ass around for everyone
49538,(You’re such a mover)
49539,I love the way you dance with anybody
49540,(The way you swing)
49541,And tease them all by sucking on your thumb
49542,You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
49543,'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth
49544,Crafty little lip tricks
49545,Tattoos on her left hip
49546,She bending as you’re spending
49547,"There’s no end to it, so baby, come on"
49548,Dressed up like a princess
49549,Betting that her skin smells better
49550,"Than the scent of every flower in the desert, come on"
49551,Dirty little lady with the pretty pink thong
49552,Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long
49553,"Doesn't care about the money, she could be with anybody"
49554,Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along
49555,(You naughty thing)
49556,"You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey"

49563,You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
49564,'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth
49565,She loves the night scene bar queen
49566,Living for the fun taking over every dance floor like she's the only one
49567,In the spotlight all night dissing everyone
49568,And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb
49569,(You’re so much cooler) When you never pull it out
49570,(So much cuter) With something in your mouth
49571,(You naughty thing)
49572,"You’re ripping up the dance floor, honey"
49573,(You naughty woman)

49586,You’re so much cooler when you never pull it out
49587,'Cause you look so much cuter with something in your...
49588,I like your pants around your feet
49589,And I like the dirt that's on your knees
49590,And I like the way you still say please
49591,While you're looking up at me
49592,You're like my favourite damn disease
49593,And I love the places that we go
49594,And I love the people that you know
49595,And I love the way you can't say no
49596,Too many long lines in a row
49597,I love the powder on your nose
49598,And now I know who you are
49599,"It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out"
49600,"(Now I did, you wonder why)"
49601,And now I know who you are
49602,"It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out"
49603,"(Now I did, you wonder why)"
49604,I like the freckles on your chest
49605,And I like the way you like me best
49606,And I like the way you're not impressed
49607,While you put me to the test
49608,I like the white stains on your dress
49609,And I love the way you pass the check
49610,And I love the good times that you wreck
49611,And I love your lack of self-respect
49612,While you're passed out on the deck
49613,I love my hands around your neck
49614,And now I know who you are
49615,"It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out"
49616,"(Now I did, you wonder why)"
49617,And now I know who you are
49618,"It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out"
49619,"(Now I did, you wonder why)"
49620,(Why not before? You never tried)
49621,"(Gone for good, and this is it)"
49622,I like your pants around your feet
49623,And I like the dirt that's on your knees
49624,And I like the way you still say please
49625,While you're looking up at me
49626,You're like my favorite damn disease
49627,And I hate the places that we go
49628,And I hate the people that you know
49629,And I hate the way you can't say no
49630,Too many long lines in a row
49631,I hate the powder on your nose
49632,And now I know who you are
49633,"It wasn't that hard, just to figure you out"

49637,"(Now I did, you wonder why)"
49638,(Why not before? You never tried)
49639,"(Gone for good, and this is it)"
49640,Time is going by so much faster than I
49641,And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you
49642,Now I'm wondering why I've kept this bottled inside
49643,So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you
49644,"So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know"
49645,You're never gonna be alone
49646,From this moment on
49647,If you ever feel like letting go
49648,I won't let you fall
49649,You're never gonna be alone
49650,I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone
49651,"And now as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands"
49652,'Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you
49653,"So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know"
49654,You're never gonna be alone
49655,From this moment on
49656,If you ever feel like letting go
49657,I won't let you fall
49658,"When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on"
49659,We’re gonna take the world on
49660,I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone
49661,Oh!
49662,You've gotta live every single day
49663,"Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?"
49664,Don't let it slip away
49665,"Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun"
49666,Every single day
49667,"Maybe our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?"
49668,Tomorrow never comes
49669,Time is going by so much faster than I
49670,And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you
49671,You're never gonna be alone
49672,From this moment on
49673,If you ever feel like letting go
49674,I won't let you fall
49675,"When all hope is gone, I know that you can carry on"
49676,We’re gonna take the world on
49677,I'll hold you 'til the hurt is gone
49678,I'm gonna be there always
49679,I won't be missing one more day
49680,I'm gonna be there always
49681,I won't be missing one more day
49682,The first words that come out
49683,And I can see this song will be about you
49684,I can't believe that I can breathe without you
49685,But all I need to do is carry on
49686,The next line I write down
49687,And there's a tear that falls between the pages
49688,I know that pain's supposed to heal in stages
49689,But it depends which one I'm standing on
49690,"I write lines down, then rip them up"
49691,Describing love can't be this tough
49692,"I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if"
49693,I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
49694,Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
49695,"Play it for the world, but it won't mean much"
49696,Unless I sing this song to you
49697,I'm dying to show you
49698,This could end happily ever after
49699,There doesn't ever have to be disaster
49700,And all you have to do is sing along
49701,"I write lines down, then rip them up"
49702,Impossible describing love
49703,"I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if"
49704,I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
49705,Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
49706,"Play it for the world, but it won't mean much"
49707,Unless I sing this song to you
49708,I could set this song on fire
49709,Sing this song to you
49710,I could set this song on fire
49711,"Light this old guitar on fire, I'd still hear the notes"
49712,"Drown the melody in water, I'd still hear its ghost"
49713,"Sing it with somebody else, but we'd be out of tune"
49714,"Play it for the world, but it won't mean much"
49715,"I could set this song on fire, send it up in smoke if"
49716,I could throw it in the river and watch it sinking slowly
49717,Tie the pages to a plane and send it to the moon
49718,"Play it for the world, but it won't mean much"
49719,Unless I sing this song to you
49720,I could set this song on fire
49721,Unless I sing this song to you
49722,"I could set this, I could set this"
49723,I wanna sing this song to you
49724,I could set this song on fire
49725,Sing this song to you
49726,"I could set this, I could set this"
49727,"This time, I wonder what it feels like"
49728,To find the one in this life
49729,The one we all dream of
49730,But dreams just aren't enough
49731,So I'll be waiting for the real thing
49732,I'll know it by the feeling
49733,The moment when we're meeting
49734,Will play out like a scene
49735,Straight off the silver screen
49736,So I'll be holding my breath
49737,Right up 'til the end
49738,Until that moment when
49739,I find the one that I'll spend forever with
49740,'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
49741,'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
49742,Someone to love with my life in their hands
49743,There's gotta be somebody for me like that
49744,'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
49745,And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
49746,There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
49747,There's gotta be somebody for me out there
49748,"Tonight, out on the street, out in the moonlight"
49749,"And dammit, this feels too right"
49750,"It's just like déja vu, me standing here with you"
49751,So I'll be holding my breath
49752,Could this be the end?
49753,Is it that moment when
49754,I find the one that I'll spend forever with?
49755,'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
49756,'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares
49757,Someone to love with my life in their hands
49758,There's gotta be somebody for me like that
49759,'Cause nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
49760,And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)
49761,There's somebody else that feels the same somewhere (The same somewhere)
49762,There's gotta be somebody for me out there
49763,"Ooh, you can't give up (When you're looking for)"
49764,A diamond in the rough ('Cause you never know)
49765,When it shows up (Make sure you're holding on)
49766,'Cause it could be the one
49767,The one you're waiting on
49768,'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there
49769,And everyone wants to feel like someone cares
49770,Someone to love with my life in their hands
49771,"There's gotta be somebody for me, oh"
49772,Nobody wants to do it on their own (Their own)
49773,And everyone wants to know they're not alone (Not alone)

49779,There's gotta be somebody for me out there
49780,"""No"" is a dirty word, never gonna say it first"
49781,"""No"" is just a thought that never crosses my mind"
49782,"Maybe in the parking lot, better bring your friend along"
49783,Better off together than just one at a time
49784,S is for the simple need
49785,E is for the ecstasy
49786,X is just to mark the spot
49787,'Cause that's the one you really want
49788,(Yes!) Sex is always the answer; it's never a question
49789,"'Cause the answer's yes, oh the answer's yes"
49790,Not just a suggestion if you ask the question
49791,"Then it's always yes, yeah!"
49792,"I'm loving what you wanna to wear, I wonder what's up under there?"
49793,Wonder if I'll ever have it under my tongue?
49794,"I'd love to try to set you free, all of you all over me"
49795,Love hearing the sound you make the second you're done
49796,S is for the simple need
49797,E is for the ecstasy
49798,X is just to mark the spot
49799,'Cause that's the one you really want

49826,Like wounded soldiers in need of healing
49827,"Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading"
49828,"Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it"
49829,I can’t believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground
49830,"But it doesn't matter 'cause I've made it up, forgive me now"
49831,"Every day I spend away, my soul's inside out"
49832,"Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow"
49833,By now you'd know that I'd come for you
49834,"No one but you, yes, I'd come for you"
49835,But only if you told me to
49836,And I'd fight for you
49837,"I'd lie, it's true"
49838,Give my life for you
49839,You know I'd always come for you
49840,"I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing"
49841,"My mind was closing, now I'm believing"
49842,I finally know just what it means to let someone in
49843,To see the side of me that no one does or ever will
49844,So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone
49845,I'd search forever just to bring you home
49846,"Here and now, this I vow"
49847,By now you'd know that I'd come for you

49854,You know I'd always come for you
49855,No matter what gets in my way
49856,As long as there's still life in me
49857,"No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you"
49858,"Yes, I'd come for you, no one but you"
49859,"Yes, I'd come for you"
49860,But only if you told me to

49867,"No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you"
49868,I'd crawl across this world for you
49869,Do anything you want me to
49870,"No matter what, remember you know I'll always come for you"
49871,You know I'll always come for you
49872,One more depending on a prayer
49873,And we all look away
49874,People pretending everywhere
49875,It's just another day
49876,There's bullets flying through the air
49877,And they still carry on
49878,We watch it happen over there
49879,And then just turn it off
49880,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49881,We must stand together
49882,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49883,There's no giving in
49884,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49885,Hand in hand forever

49887,That's when we all win

49889,"That's, that's, that's when we all win"
49890,"That's, that's, that's when we all win"
49891,They tell us everything's alright
49892,And we just go along
49893,How can we fall asleep at night
49894,When something's clearly wrong?
49895,When we could feed a starving world
49896,With what we throw away
49897,But all we serve are empty words
49898,That always taste the same
49899,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49900,We must stand together
49901,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49902,There's no giving in
49903,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49904,Hand in hand forever

49909,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49910,"That's, that's, that's when we all win"
49911,The right thing to guide us
49912,Is right here inside us
49913,No one can divide us
49914,When the light is nearly gone
49915,But just like a heartbeat
49916,The drumbeat carries on
49917,And the drumbeat carries on
49918,Just like a heartbeat
49919,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49920,We must stand together
49921,"Hey, yeah, yeah, hey, yeah"
49922,There's no giving in

49928,"That's, that's, that's when we all win"
49929,"That's, that's, that's when we all win"
49930,{Inaudible Chatter}
49931,Ohh!
49932,Lookin' like another Bob Marley day
49933,Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train
49934,And I'm down with hangin' out this afternoon
49935,We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall
49936,Cheech and Chong probably woulda' smoked them all
49937,So I'm out on the couch this afternoon
49938,Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor
49939,"If we take 'em all back, we can buy some more"
49940,So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon

49947,"Get up, and go out"
49948,Me and all my friends
49949,"We drink up, we fall down"

49974,To see what time it is
49975,From the moment I wake up
49976,I just love being with my friends
49977,"We barely get by, but have the best times"
49978,And hope it never ends
49979,We drink all day till we fall down
49980,So we can do it all again
49981,It's not the human walk
49982,It's the human race
49983,If you ain't livin' on the edge
49984,You're takin' too much space

50274,Fathers hands were lined with dirt
50275,From long days in the field
50276,And mothers hands are serving meals
50277,In a café on Main Street
50278,With mouths to feed
50279,Just trying to keep clothing on our backs
50280,And all I hear about
50281,"Is how it's so bad, it's so bad"
50282,"It's too bad, it's stupid"
50283,"Too late, so wrong, so long"
50284,It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
50285,"Let's walk, let's talk"
50286,(Let's talk)
50287,You left without saying goodbye
50288,Although I'm sure you tried
50289,You call the house from time to time
50290,To make sure we're alive
50291,But you weren't there
50292,Right when I needed you the most
50293,And now I dream about it
50294,"And how it's so bad, it's so bad"
50295,"It's too bad, it's stupid"
50296,"Too late, so wrong, so long"

50303,"Let's walk, let's talk"
50304,Father's hands are lined with guilt
50305,For tearing us apart
50306,Guess it turned out in the end
50307,Just look at where we are
50308,We made it out
50309,We still got clothing on our backs
50310,And now I scream about it
50311,"And how it's so bad, it's so bad"
50312,"It's too bad, it's stupid"
50313,"Too late, so wrong, so long"
50314,It's too bad that we had no time to rewind

50316,"It's too bad, it's stupid"
50317,"Too late, so wrong, so long"
50318,It's too bad that we had no time to rewind
50319,"Let's walk, let's talk"
50320,"Long time, let's walk, let's talk"
50321,I can taste the color of the lights
50322,Take one of those and two of these
50323,Then watch the walls begin to breathe
50324,I can taste the color of the lights
50325,Wings are growing out of me
50326,The floor is floating underneath
50327,I can see the future burning bright
50328,Future burning bright
50329,The ceiling has us mesmerized
50330,It feels like we could never die
50331,Heading for the dark side of the moon
50332,As we lift off into the sky
50333,Invincible and so alive
50334,Ten feet tall and fucking bulletproof
50335,Insanity is setting in
50336,Reality is getting thin
50337,The universe just started slowing down
50338,Yet suddenly we're traveling
50339,A million miles an hour
50340,A million miles an hour
50341,We're going a million miles an hour
50342,A million miles an hour
50343,When shadows soon start breaking free
50344,No longer held by gravity
50345,(How did we get so far from the ground?)
50346,Speaking to the galaxy
50347,Received and sending back to me
50348,I can finally hear the speed of sound
50349,Speed of fucking sound
50350,I like this everlasting pill
50351,'Cause time itself is standing still
50352,Why's the room still spinning just the same?
50353,Turn off your phone so no one calls
50354,'Cause you and I are tripping balls
50355,I can still hear ringing in my brain
50356,Insanity is setting in
50357,Reality is getting thin
50358,See no signs of ever coming down
50359,Yet suddenly we're traveling
50360,A million miles an hour
50361,A million miles an hour
50362,We're going a million miles an hour
50363,A million miles an hour
50364,Insanity is setting in
50365,Reality is getting thin
50366,The particles are dancing all around
50367,I can't deny the hardest thing for me
50368,Is finding time to finally breathe
50369,See no signs of ever coming down
50370,Another wave is coming in
50371,A million miles an hour
50372,A million miles an hour
50373,We're going a million miles an hour
50374,A million miles an hour
50375,A million miles an hour

50447,"What are you, what are you waiting for?"
50448,I'm back in my hometown
50449,And Main Street's dying now
50450,It's like there's nothing left of it
50451,No more high school grounds
50452,They tore that building down
50453,And everything with it I miss
50454,I call up my old friends
50455,So lost since I've seen them
50456,Feels like we're back there instantly to me
50457,We'd all meet at Shawn's
50458,The backyard fire's on
50459,And we'd start telling tales of how life used to be
50460,The years have come and gone
50461,But these stories carry on
50462,"Looking back, they're better than they used to be"
50463,'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin'
50464,And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
50465,But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
50466,And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty
50467,Every girl we were with never cost any money
50468,And we drank more tequila than any man alive
50469,"And the story goes on, and gets a little better"
50470,Every time we're together
50471,It's funny how we change
50472,And some things stay the same
50473,"God, I miss the glory days, always"
50474,Daylight getting near
50475,We shed a few more tears
50476,"Lord, I love the memories we've made"
50477,The years have come and gone
50478,But the stories carry on
50479,"Looking back, they're better than they used to be"
50480,'Cause you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin'
50481,And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
50482,But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
50483,And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty
50484,Every girl we were with never cost any money
50485,And we drank more tequila than any man alive
50486,"And the story goes on, and gets a little better"
50487,Every time we're together
50488,"Well, you should've seen the size of the guys we were fightin'"
50489,And we shouldn't be alive at the speeds we were driving
50490,But Momma always taught us never to tell a lie
50491,And every ten yard pass always turned into twenty
50492,Every girl we were with never cost any money
50493,And we drank more tequila than any man alive
50494,"And the story goes on, and gets a little better"
50495,Every time we're together
50496,"And the story goes on, and gets a little better"
50497,Every time we're together
50498,"Well, I wanted you"
50499,I wanted no one else
50500,I thought it through
50501,I got you to myself
50502,You got off
50503,Every time you got on to me
50504,I got caught up
50505,In favorable slavery
50506,Was it wrong? Was it wrong?
50507,I guess it wasn't really right
50508,I guess it wasn't meant to be
50509,It didn't matter what they said
50510,'Cause we were good in bed
50511,I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
50512,For all the wrong reasons
50513,"No, it didn't matter what I tried"
50514,It's just a little hard to leave
50515,When you're going down on me
50516,I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
50517,For all the wrong reasons
50518,"Well, you know my friends"
50519,They know your enemies
50520,I'd pretend
50521,Not to hear what they said to me
50522,'Cause I got off
50523,Every time you got on to me
50524,Was it wrong to go along with insanity?
50525,Was it wrong? Was it wrong?
50526,I guess it wasn't really right
50527,I guess it wasn't meant to be
50528,It didn't matter what they said
50529,'Cause we were good in bed
50530,I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
50531,For all the wrong reasons
50532,"No, it didn't matter what I tried"
50533,It's just a little hard to leave
50534,When you're going down on me
50535,I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
50536,For all the wrong reasons
50537,You know I’m the best
50538,When I stick it on your chest
50539,I know you don't care
50540,I can stick it anywhere
50541,"On the bus, it's the best"
50542,When I blow it on your chest
50543,I know you don't care
50544,I can shove it anywhere
50545,I guess it wasn't what I wanted
50546,Wasn't really what I thought
50547,Thought it was the day I got
50548,I want it all to go away
50549,I guess it wasn't what I wanted
50550,Wasn't really what I thought
50551,Thought it was the day I got
50552,I want it all to go away
50553,I guess it wasn't what I wanted
50554,Wasn't really what I thought
50555,Thought it was the day I got
50556,I want it all to go away
50557,I guess it wasn't what I wanted
50558,Wasn't really what I thought
50559,Thought it was the day I got
50560,I want it all to go away
50561,I guess it wasn't really right

50570,I guess I stuck around so I could watch us fight
50571,For all the wrong reasons
50572,"I know it's late, but something's on my mind"
50573,"It couldn't wait, there's never any time"
50574,'Cause life slips by without a warning
50575,And I'm tired of ignoring
50576,All the space that's between you and I
50577,Let's lock the door behind us
50578,They won't find us
50579,Make the whole world wait
50580,While we dance around this bedroom
50581,Like we've only got tonight
50582,Not about to let you
50583,Go until the morning light
50584,"You can be my whole world, if I can be your satellite"
50585,Let's dance around this bedroom
50586,Like tonight's our only night
50587,Let's dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
50588,Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
50589,Do you recall how long it must have been
50590,Since any room held only you and me?
50591,And every song that sings about it
50592,Says that we can't live without it
50593,Now I know just what that really means
50594,Let's lock the door behind us
50595,They won't find us
50596,Make the whole world wait
50597,While we dance around this bedroom

50604,Let's dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
50605,Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
50606,"Dance with me around the moon (You and I, every night)"
50607,Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
50608,I can't believe
50609,The days turn into years
50610,I hate to see
50611,The moments disappear
50612,But tonight the sand is stopping
50613,Take the hourglass and drop it
50614,So we can stay
50615,Inside this atmosphere
50616,Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)
50617,Dance around this room (I'll be your satellite)

50623,Let's dance around this bedroom (I'll be your satellite)
50624,Table has been set
50625,Serving up the worst regret
50626,Waiting for the chance
50627,Serpents love the circumstance
50628,Speaking to the sky
50629,Sleight of hand and cheap disguise
50630,Naming of your price
50631,Payment for the sacrifice
50632,Demon in your ear
50633,Evil on your breath
50634,You've brought the wolves right here
50635,You've brought the kiss of death
50636,You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)

50644,Committed to your task
50645,Jealousy behind your mask
50646,Pieces are in place
50647,Thirty for your last disgrace
50648,Holding of your tongue
50649,Dealings that can't be undone
50650,Blood over your hands
50651,Pawn inside the master plan
50652,Demon in your ear
50653,Evil on your breath

50666,Nothing but shame and there's nowhere to run
50667,Who takes the blame?
50668,Why have they come?
50669,What in God's name have you done?
50670,You just betrayed him (You just betrayed...)

50682,"(Hey, hey)"
50683,She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door
50684,You grow up quick when you grow up poor
50685,It's the only way to LA that she knows
50686,"The Hollywood pose: teeth, tits, and toes"
50687,It didn't take her long to leave the boulevard
50688,So many Five Star friends with black credit cards
50689,She'd try anything once
50690,'Cause anything goes
50691,It never comes easy when you're digging for gold
50692,"(Hey, hey)"
50693,"Well, she ain't no Cinderella"
50694,When she's getting undressed
50695,'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west
50696,Far too pretty to be giving it cheap
50697,That's why she's making six figures working three days a week
50698,"Yeah, she'd even break a promise in the promise-land"
50699,She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
50700,She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can
50701,She didn't make it this far by just shaking hands
50702,"(Hey, hey)"
50703,I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book
50704,City Hall would probably fall off if anyone got a look
50705,Every A-List player is her favorite friend
50706,Since they all taste the same in the back of the Benz
50707,A congressman would call her every once in a while
50708,Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile
50709,She'd done everyone once and everyone knows
50710,You gotta get a little dirty when you're digging for gold
50711,"(Hey, hey)"

50733,"Uncle Sam taught him to shoot, maybe a little too well"
50734,"Finger on the trigger, loaded bullet"
50735,He hit the stage so full of rage And let the whole world know it
50736,"Six feet away, they heard him say ""Oh God, don't let him pull it"""
50737,"""Please God, don't let him pull it"""
50738,How could you put us through it?
50739,His brother watched you do it
50740,How could you take his life away? (What made you think you had the right?)
50741,How could you be so full of hate? (To take away somebody's life)
50742,And when I heard you let him die and made the world all wonder why
50743,"I sat at home and on my own, I cried alone"
50744,And scratched your name on the side of a bullet
50745,And in the wake of his mistake So many lives are broken
50746,Gone forever from a loaded bullet
50747,And no excuse that you could use Could pull somebody through it
50748,"And to this day so many say, ""God why'd you let him do it?"""
50749,How could you let him do it?
50750,How could you put us through it?

50762,On the side of a bullet
50763,On the side of a bullet
50764,On the side of a bullet
50765,He was my best friend
50766,"Well, I tried to help him"
50767,But he traded everything for suffering
50768,And found himself alone
50769,I watched the lying turn into hiding
50770,"With scars on both his lips, his fingertips were melted to the bone"
50771,But I can still remember what his face looked like
50772,When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night
50773,"Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now"
50774,"Tell me what you know, tell me what you gone and done now"
50775,"A gun would do the trick, get it over with"

50779,Three days no sleeping
50780,"Well, he gave up eating"
50781,"He sold his mother's rings, she said nothing"
50782,And pretended not to know
50783,He started stealing to supply the feeling
50784,Found out he pulled a knife on someone's wife
50785,And held it to her throat
50786,But I can still remember what his face looked like
50787,When I found him in an alley in the middle of the night

51320,I better learn how to crawl
51321,Learn how to crawl

51367,"Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them"
51368,"Well, I'd rather start off slow"
51369,This whole thing's like some sort of race
51370,"Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place"
